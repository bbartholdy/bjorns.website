	abstract = {Sex estimation is an important part of creating a biological profile for skeletal remains in forensics. The commonly used methods for developing sex estimation equations are discriminant function analysis (DFA) and logistic regression (LogR). LogR equations provide a probability of the predicted sex, while DFA relies on cutoff points to segregate males and females, resulting in a rigid dichotomization of the sexes. This is problematic because sexual dimorphism exists along a continuum and there can be considerable overlap in trait expression between the sexes. In this study, we used humeral measurements to compare the performance of DFA and LogR and found them to be very similar under multiple conditions. The overall cross-validated (leave-one-out) accuracy of DFA (75.76–95.14\%) was slightly higher than LogR (75.76–93.82\%) for simple and multiple variable equations, and also performed better under varying sample sizes (94.03\% vs. 93.78\%). Three of five DFA equations outperformed LogR under the B index, while all five LogR equations outperformed the DFA equations under the Q index. Both methods saw an improvement in overall accuracy (DFA: 86.74–95.79\%; LogR: 86.74–95.76\%) when individuals with a classification probability lower than 0.80 were excluded. Additionally, we propose a method for calculating additional cutoff points (PMarks) based on posterior probability values. In conclusion, we recommend using LogR over DFA due to the increased flexibility, robusticity, and benefits for future users of the statistical models; however, if DFA is preferred, use of the proposed PMarks facilitates future analysis while avoiding unnecessary dichotomization.},

	abstract = {Abstract The main aim of this study is to present a novel method of nonadult (ca. 1–19 years) age-at-death estimation using the dental wear of deciduous, mixed deciduous-permanent, and permanent dentitions, including the incisors, canines, premolars, and first and second molars. The stage-based method is derived from degrees of dental wear in known-age (n = 39) and estimated-age (n = 11) nonadults containing 951 teeth from the predominately 19th century cemetery of Middenbeemster, The Netherlands. The need for such a method is warranted in cases where dental development and/or eruption cannot be assessed for age-at-death estimation. As well, by establishing a baseline for normal age-related nonadult tooth wear, users may better document wear that could be due to extramasticatory behaviours. The regression analysis reveals a strong quadratic correlation—F(2, 47) = 555.1, p {\textless} .001, R2 = .95, standard error of the estimate = 1.14, residual sum of squares (RSS) = 68.89, predicted residual error sum of squares (PRESS) = 77.67—between age and wear and multivariate adaptive regression splines (R2 = .95, generalised cross validation = 1.67, RSS = 67.68, PRESS = 89.34), which are used to develop an R-package that users may employ to estimate age-at-death from dental wear. The accuracy of this method (78–98\%) is evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Analyses of males versus females, deciduous versus permanent, upper versus lower, and anterior versus posterior teeth revealed no apparent reason to warrant separate methods for these groups of separated dentitions. This method fills a disciplinary gap in the understudied area of deciduous and nonadult dental wear and hopes to stimulate much future research. With the R-package, we also provide the foundation and framework for the development of additional reference populations across different spatiotemporal contexts, to make the method more widely applicable.},

	abstract = {Dental calculus has proven to contain a wealth of information on the dietary habits of past populations. These insights have, to a large extent, been obtained by the extraction and identification of starch granules contained within the mineralised dental plaque from a wide range of regions and time periods. The scope of previous studies have been limited to microfossil extraction and identification to reconstruct dietary preferences from the archaeological record, and few studies have attempted to address the biases of starch retention in dental calculus. Those that have considered this problem have been limited to in vivo studies on modern humans and non-human primates. Here, we present a multispecies oral biofilm model, which allows experimental research on starch incorporation and retention to be conducted on in vitro dental calculus in a controlled laboratory setting. The biofilms were exposed to treatment solutions with known quantities of dietary starches (wheat and potato) during the 25 days growth period. After this, the starch granules were extracted from the mature biofilm (by dissolution in EDTA), and counted. We show that the granule counts extracted from the model dental calculus represented a low proportion (ranging from 0.06\% to 0.16\%) of the total number of granules exposed to the biofilms throughout the experiment. Additionally, we found that the ratios of granule sizes from the extracted starch granules differed from the original treatment solutions, with large granules ({\textgreater}20 μm) consistently being under-represented. We also found a positive correlation between the absolute granule counts and dry-weight of the biofilm (r = 0.659, 90\%CI[0.463, 0.794]), meaning the absolute quantity of starch granules will increase as the size of the calculus deposit increases. A similar, but weaker correlation was found between the concentration (count per mg) of granules and dry-weight (r = 0.3, 90\%CI[0.0618, 0.506]). Our results complement and reinforce previous in vivo studies suggesting that dental calculus presents a very small, and partly biased picture of the original dietary intake of starches, with an over-representation of plants producing granules smaller than 20 μm in size. The experimental model presented here is well-suited to address the need for further validation of methods and biases associated with dietary research on dental calculus.},

	abstract = {Dental calculus is an excellent source of information on the dietary patterns of past populations, including consumption of plant-based items. The detection of plant-derived residues such as alkaloids and their metabolites in dental calculus provides direct evidence of consumption by individuals within a population. We conducted a study on 41 individuals from Middenbeemster, a 19th century rural Dutch archaeological site. Skeletal and dental analysis was performed to explore potential relationships between pathological conditions/lesions and the presence of alkaloids. We also explored other factors potentially affecting the detection of alkaloids, including sample weight and skeletal preservation. Dental calculus was sampled and analysed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS). We were able to detect nicotine, cotinine, caffeine, theophylline, and salicylic acid. By detecting these compounds we are able to show the consumption of tea and coffee and smoking of tobacco on an individual scale, which is also confirmed by historic documentation and identification of pipe notches in the dentition. Nicotine and/or cotinine was present in 60\% of individuals with at least one visible pipe notch. We find some influence of skeletal preservation on the detection of alkaloids and salicylic acid, with higher quantities of compounds extracted from well-preserved individuals, and also observe a relationship between weight of the calculus sample and raw quantity of the detected compounds, and we were able to detect alkaloids in samples as small as 2 mg. We found correlations between chronic maxillary sinusitis and the presence of multiple alkaloids.We show that there are many limitations that will need to be addressed going forward with this type of analysis, and stress the need for more systematic research on the consumption of alkaloid-containing items and their subsequent concentration and preservation in dental calculus, in addition to how mode of consumption may affect concentrations on different parts of the dentition. Despite the limitations, this preliminary study illustrates the many benefits of using calculus to target a variety of compounds that could have been ingested as medicine or diet, or consumed in a different manner. This method allows us to directly address specific individuals, which can be especially useful in individuals that are not always well-documented in historic documentation, such as rural populations, children and women.},
