  abstract = {More than 700 bacterial species or phylotypes, of which over 50\% have not been cultivated, have been detected in the oral cavity. Our purposes were (i) to utilize culture-independent molecular techniques to extend our knowledge on the breadth of bacterial diversity in the healthy human oral cavity, including not-yet-cultivated bacteria species, and (ii) to determine the site and subject specificity of bacterial colonization. Nine sites from five clinically healthy subjects were analyzed. Sites included tongue dorsum, lateral sides of tongue, buccal epithelium, hard palate, soft palate, supragingival plaque of tooth surfaces, subgingival plaque, maxillary anterior vestibule, and tonsils. 16S rRNA genes from sample DNA were amplified, cloned, and transformed into Escherichia coli. Sequences of 16S rRNA genes were used to determine species identity or closest relatives. In 2,589 clones, 141 predominant species were detected, of which over 60\% have not been cultivated. Thirteen new phylotypes were identified. Species common to all sites belonged to the genera Gemella, Granulicatella, Streptococcus, and Veillonella. While some species were subject specific and detected in most sites, other species were site specific. Most sites possessed 20 to 30 different predominant species, and the number of predominant species from all nine sites per individual ranged from 34 to 72. Species typically associated with periodontitis and caries were not detected. There is a distinctive predominant bacterial flora of the healthy oral cavity that is highly diverse and site and subject specific. It is important to fully define the human microflora of the healthy oral cavity before we can understand the role of bacteria in oral disease.},

The synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence technique using a white beam was employed as an analytical method. The set of samples were extracted from different dental elements of the same subject, who did not require any other clinical care. By means of analyzing the Ca/P molar ratio an estimation of the main crystallographic structure was attained, by simple comparison with stoichiometric values of the several crystalline structures that compose the calculus. The results showed a slowly progressive transformation of the initial crystalline structures (brushite) into more stable structures (hydroxyapatite), passing through octacalcium phosphate and whitlockite. The concentrations of mayor components (Ca and P) as a function of time followed a sigmoid curve. The analysis of trace element concentratios versus time indicated a null or small correlation of concentration values with the kinetics of the crystallization process. \textcopyright{} 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Efficient adapter trimming algorithms are also needed to process the growing amount of data generated per sequencing run. FINDINGS: We introduce AdapterRemoval v2, a major revision of AdapterRemoval v1, which introduces (i) striking improvements in throughput, through the use of single instruction, multiple data (SIMD; SSE1 and SSE2) instructions and multi-threading support, (ii) the ability to handle datasets containing reads or read-pairs with different adapters or adapter pairs, (iii) simultaneous demultiplexing and adapter trimming, (iv) the ability to reconstruct adapter sequences from paired-end reads for poorly documented data sets, and (v) native gzip and bzip2 support. CONCLUSIONS: We show that AdapterRemoval v2 compares favorably with existing tools, while offering superior throughput to most alternatives examined here, both for single and multi-threaded operations.},

Two of the greatest dietary shifts in human evolution involved the adoption of carbohydrate-rich Neolithic (farming) diets (beginning approximately 10,000 years before the present) and the more recent advent of industrially processed flour and sugar (in approximately 1850). Here, we show that calcified dental plaque (dental calculus) on ancient teeth preserves a detailed genetic record throughout this period. Data from 34 early European skeletons indicate that the transition from hunter-gatherer to farming shifted the oral microbial community to a disease-associated configuration. The composition of oral microbiota remained unexpectedly constant between Neolithic and medieval times, after which (the now ubiquitous) cariogenic bacteria became dominant, apparently during the Industrial Revolution. Modern oral microbiotic ecosystems are markedly less diverse than historic populations, which might be contributing to chronic oral (and other) disease in postindustrial lifestyles.},

The development of dental calculus is a dynamic process that starts with a nonmineralized biofilm which eventually calcifies. Nonmineralized dental biofilm entraps particles from the oral cavity, including large amounts of oral bacteria, human proteins, viruses and food remnants, and preserves their DNA. The process of mineralization involves metabolic activities of the bacterial colonies and strengthens the attachment of nonmineralized biofilms to the tooth surface. From a clinical point of view, dental calculus always harbors a living, nonmineralized biofilm, jeopardizing the integrity of the dento-gingival or implanto-mucosal unit. This narrative review presents a brief historical overview of dental calculus formation and its clinical relevance in modern periodontal practice.},

Since it has been shown that not all bones are found in a forensic case, discriminant function equations should be derived for various bones of the body to assist in sex determination. The aim of this study was to derive discriminant function equations for sex determination from measurements of the patella. Methods In a prospective study, dimensions of patella were measured using the fresh cadavers of Iranian population as referred to the Tehran's Legal Medicine Organization. Results A total sample of 113 (57 male, 56 female) patellae were measured using three measurements. Stepwise and direct analyses were performed with the average accuracy of 92.9\% for sex classification, thereby making the patella useful for sex determination. Conclusions The results of this study confirm the high accuracy of using the measurement of the patella for sex determination. Until further data collected suggests otherwise, the results expected in present study are limited to forensic cases of the Iranian population.},

Forty supragingival plaque samples were collected from smokers of a single tobacco type and non-smokers seeking treatment at the University Dental Hospital Sharjah, UAE. DMFT (decayed, missing and filled teeth) was determined for all participants who were divided into two groups: no-low caries (NC-LC: DMFT\,=\,0\textendash 4; n\,=\,18) and moderate-high caries (MC-HC: DMFT\,=\,5\textendash 20; n\,=\,22). 16S rRNA gene was sequenced using third-generation sequencing with Nanopore technology. Microbiome composition and diversity were compared. Caries was most common among cigarette smokers. Supragingival microbiota were significantly altered among smokers of different tobacco types. In cigarette smokers, cariogenic bacteria from genus Streptococcus (including S. mutans) were significantly more among subjects with NC-LC, while Lactobacilli (including L. fermentum) were more among subjects with MC-HC. In medwakh smokers, several periodontopathogens were significantly elevated in subjects with NC-LC, while other pathogenic bacteria (as Klebsiella pneumoniae) were more in those with MC-HC. Cigarette and alternative tobacco smoking had a significant impact on the supragingival microbiome. Indeed, further studies are required to unravel the consequences of oral dysbiosis triggered by smoking. This could pave the way for microbiota-based interventional measures for restoring a healthy oral microbiome which could be a promising strategy to prevent dental caries.},

Studies on lung function and respiratory mortality were also considered. Results Fifteen studies, including seven cohort, six cross-sectional, one case control and one randomized control trial were found. Coffee consumption was generally associated with a reduction in prevalence of asthma. The association of coffee with natural honey was an effective treatment for persistent post-infectious cough. One case-control study found higher risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with coffee consumption. No association was found with the evolution of COPD or sarcoidosis. Coffee was associated with a reduction in respiratory mortality, and one study found improved lung function in coffee consumers. Smoking was a significant confounder in most studies. Conclusions Coffee consumption was associated with some positive effects on the respiratory system. There was however limited available evidence, mostly from cross sectional and retrospective studies. The only prospective cohort studies were those reporting on respiratory mortality. These results suggest that coffee consumption may be a part of a healthy lifestyle leading to reduced respiratory morbidity.},

Generally speaking about aggression, evidence has shown that drivers who usually express aggressive behaviors more frequently tend, at the same time, to have higher rates of road crashes or traffic incidents. Furthermore, in most cases, the situations in which aggressive behaviors appear are typical of normal current traffic conditions, turning this behavior into something very common, and into a very serious road safety issue. This has also been related with the clear lack of Road Safety Education that is evident in most of the countries. The aim of this study was to describe the factors and perceptions related to the aggressive behavior of verbally insulting and shouting while driving. In this study, an extensive list of behaviors, that experts more or less unanimously consider as aggressive driving, was described; one of them was labeled shouting and insulting. The sample was obtained from a random sampling proportional to and representative of the segments of the population by age, sex, region and size of the municipality. The survey was aimed at Spanish drivers over 14 years. The starting sample size was 1,100 surveys. As a result, shouting and insulting is not considered such a dangerous offense as it is driving under the influence of alcohol, but we cannot deny that there are many types of bad or risky maneuvers that could be banned from a legal point of view. The degree of social tolerance towards such behavior is variable. Some individuals merely ignore them, accepting them as something inevitable. Multiple types of risky maneuvers and deliberated misbehaviors, which are (formally and informally) already forbidden from a legal point of view, make other drivers and pedestrians uncomfortable and restrict their movements, creating violent, stressful and risky situations, and they are still performed by drivers. In short, aggression in driving is one of them. As a conclusion, there is a high prevalence of this phenomenon among Spanish drivers. Furthermore, most of the aggressive expressions related to shouting and cursing on the road are preceded by subjective factors such as stress, fatigue and personality traits, which may be intervened through the strengthening of road safety education and road safety campaigns}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is caused by a highly complex consortium of bacteria that establishes as biofilms in subgingival pockets. It is a disease that occurs worldwide and its consequences are a major health concern. Investigations in situ are not possible and the bacterial community varies greatly between patients and even within different loci. Due to the high complexity of the consortium and the availability of samples, a clear definition of the pathogenic bacteria and their mechanisms of pathogenicity are still not available. In the current study we addressed the need of a defined model system by advancing our previously described subgingival biofilm model towards a bacterial composition that reflects the one observed in diseased sites of patients and analysed the structure of these biofilms. RESULTS: We further developed the growth media by systematic variation of key components resulting in improved stability and the firm establishment of spirochetes in the 10-species subgingival Zurich biofilm model. A high concentration of heat-inactivated human serum allowed the best proliferation of the used species. Therefore we further investigated these biofilms by analysing their structure by confocal laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. The species showed mutual interactions as expected from other studies. The abundances of all organisms present in this model were determined by microscopic counting following species-specific identification by both fluorescence in situ hybridisation and immunofluorescence. The newly integrated treponemes were the most abundant organisms. CONCLUSIONS: The use of 50\% of heat-inactivated human serum used in the improved growth medium resulted in significantly thicker and more stable biofilms, and the quantitative representation of the used species represents the in vivo community of periodontitis patients much closer than in biofilms grown in the two media with less or no human serum. The appearance of T. denticola, P. gingivalis, and T. forsythia in the top layer of the biofilms, and the high abundance of T. denticola, reflects well the microbial situation observed at diseased sites. The improved model biofilms will allow further investigations of interactions between individual species and of the effects of atmospheric or nutritional changes, as well as interactions with tissue cells.},

  abstract = {This study analyzes data sharing regarding mitochondrial, Y chromosomal and autosomal polymorphisms in a total of 162 papers on ancient human DNA published between 1988 and 2013. The estimated sharing rate was not far from totality (97.6\% {$\pm$} 2.1\%) and substantially higher than observed in other fields of genetic research (evolutionary, medical and forensic genetics). Both a questionnaire-based survey and the examination of Journals' editorial policies suggest that this high sharing rate cannot be simply explained by the need to comply with stakeholders requests. Most data were made available through body text, but the use of primary databases increased in coincidence with the introduction of complete mitochondrial and next-generation sequencing methods. Our study highlights three important aspects. First, our results imply that researchers' awareness of the importance of openness and transparency for scientific progress may complement stakeholders' policies in achieving very high sharing rates. Second, widespread data sharing does not necessarily coincide with a prevalent use of practices which maximize data findability, accessibility, useability and preservation. A detailed look at the different ways in which data are released can be very useful to detect failures to adopt the best sharing modalities and understand how to correct them. Third and finally, the case of human paleogenetics tells us that a widespread awareness of the importance of Open Science may be important to build reliable scientific practices even in the presence of complex experimental challenges.},

As the salivary secretion is a reflex response controlled by both parasympathetic and sympathetic secretomotor nerves, it can be influenced by several stimuli. Moreover, patients taking medication which influences either the central nervous system or the peripheral nervous system, or medication which mimic the latter as a side effect, will have an altered salivary composition and salivary volume. Patients suffering from certain systemic diseases may present the same salivary alterations. The circadian rhythm determines both the volume of saliva that will and can be secreted and the salivary electrolyte concentrations. Dietary influences and the patient's age also have an impact on composition and volume of saliva. The latter implies a wide variation in composition both inter- and intra-individually. Sampling must therefore be performed under standardized conditions. The greatest advantage, when compared to blood sample collection, is that saliva is readily accessible and collectible. Consequently, it can be used in clinically difficult situations, such as in children, handicapped and anxious patients, where blood sampling could be a difficult act to perform.},

The present study reviews the evidence of Chagas disease in organic remains excavated from archeological sites and discusses two findings in greater detail, both with lesions suggestive of chagasic megacolon and confirmed by molecular biology techniques. One of these sites is located in the United States, on the border between Texas and Mexico and the other in state of Minas Gerais, in the Brazilian cerrado (savannah). Dated prior to contact with Europeans, these results confirm that Chagas disease affected prehistoric human groups in other regions outside the Andean altiplanos and other transmission areas on the Pacific Coast, previously considered the origin of T. cruzi infection in the human host.},

Some parasite species that infect humans were inherited from pre-hominids, and were shared with other phylogenetically close host species, but other parasite species were acquired from the environment as humans evolved. Human migration spread inherited parasites throughout the globe. To recover and trace the origin and evolution of infectious diseases, paleoparasitology was created.

We reviewed mechanisms by which smoking increases the risk of infection and the epidemiology of smoking-related infection, and delineated implications of this increased risk of infection among cigarette smokers.The MEDLINE database was searched for articles on the mechanisms and epidemiology of smoking-related infectious diseases. English-language articles and selected cross-references were included.Mechanisms by which smoking increases the risk of infections include structural changes in the respiratory tract and a decrease in immune response. Cigarette smoking is a substantial risk factor for important bacterial and viral infections. For example, smokers incur a 2- to 4-fold increased risk of invasive pneumococcal disease. Influenza risk is severalfold higher and is much more severe in smokers than nonsmokers. Perhaps the greatest public health impact of smoking on infection is the increased risk of tuberculosis, a particular problem in underdeveloped countries where smoking rates are increasing rapidly.The clinical implications of our findings include emphasizing the importance of smoking cessation as part of the therapeutic plan for people with serious infectious diseases or periodontitis, and individuals who have positive results of tuberculin skin tests. Controlling exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke in children is important to reduce the risks of meningococcal disease and otitis media, and in adults to reduce the risk of influenza and meningococcal disease. Other recommendations include pneumococcal and influenza vaccine in all smokers and acyclovir treatment for varicella in smokers.Arch Intern Med. 2004;164:2206-2216--{$>$}}

Mineral preservation state can be assessed using infrared spectroscopy which provides information on crystal disorder at the atomic level and mineral composition. Here we present a new approach to evaluate carbonate hydroxyapatite atomic disorder using infrared spectroscopy and the standard KBr sample mounting method. We show that by repeated grinding of the sample and then plotting the infrared splitting factor against the width of the major phosphate absorption peak after each grinding, grinding curves with well defined trend lines can be obtained. The offsets between curves reflect differences in atomic disorder. We show that grinding curve offsets can be used to evaluate the state of preservation of bone, dentine and enamel mineral.},

Characterization of the extent of disorder is of much interest, as this relates to the stability and hence solubility of the crystals. Here the infrared spectrometry grinding curve approach developed for calcite, is adapted to carbonate hydroxyapatites. The infrared splitting factor is plotted against the full width at half height of the strong phosphate absorption peak as a function of increased grinding of the sample. By doing so, the contribution of particle size to the shape of the peaks is better separated from the contribution of atomic disorder to peak shape. It is shown that differences in disorder exist between dentine, cementum, and bone crystals which could reflect crystal size and/or atomic defects within the crystal. It is als shown that systematic differences exist between enamel samples from different taxa, which we assume only reflects atomic disorder differences within these large crystals. The method can be used to characterize atomic disorder in natural hydroxyapatites, as well as in the many different types of synthetic hydroxyapatites used for biomedical implants.},

  abstract = {Differentiation between external contamination and incorporation of drugs or their metabolites from inside the body via blood, sweat or sebum is a general issue in hair analysis and of high concern when interpreting analytical results. In hair analysis for cannabinoids the most common target is {$\Delta$}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), sometimes cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabinol (CBN) are determined additionally. After repeated external contamination by cannabis smoke these analytes are known to be found in hair even after performing multiple washing steps. A widely accepted strategy to unequivocally prove active cannabis consumption is the analysis of hair extracts for the oxidative metabolite 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC (THC-COOH). Although the acidic nature of this metabolite suggests a lower rate of incorporation into the hair matrix compared to THC, it is not fully understood up to now why hair concentrations of THC-COOH are generally found to be much lower (mostly {$<$}10pg/mg) than the corresponding THC concentrations. {$\Delta$}9-Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid A (THCA A) is the preliminary end product of the THC biosynthesis in the cannabis plant. Unlike THC it is non-psychoactive and can be regarded as a `precursor' of THC being largely decarboxylated when heated or smoked. The presented work shows for the first time that THCA A is not only detectable in blood and urine of cannabis consumers but also in THC positive hair samples. A pilot experiment performed within this study showed that after oral intake of THCA A on a regular basis no relevant incorporation into hair occurred. It can be concluded that THCA A in hair almost exclusively derives from external contamination e.g. by side stream smoke. Elevated temperatures during the analytical procedure, particularly under alkaline conditions, can lead to decarboxylation of THCA A and accordingly increase THC concentrations in hair. Additionally, it has to be kept in mind that in hair samples tested positive for THCA A at least a part of the `non-artefact' THC probably derives from external contamination as well, because in condensate of cannabis smoke both THC and THCA A are present in relevant amounts. External contamination by side stream smoke could therefore explain the great differences in THC and THC-COOH hair concentrations commonly found in cannabis users.},

Methods: The following data sources were used: Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process \& Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily Update, and OLDMEDLINE); Cumulative Index to Nursing \& Allied Health Literature; Evidence Based Medicine of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects; EMBASE; Health and Psychosocial Instruments; HealthSTAR; International Pharmaceutical Abstracts; PubMed; and Google Scholar from the earliest record until July 2005. Studies were selected from randomized controlled clinical trials and longitudinal, cohort, case-control, and epidemiological studies. Searches were limited to English language and human studies. Results: A total of 728 articles were searched for relevancy, determined by article title, abstract, and full copy, resulting in a yield of 19 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These articles were read and scored independently by the reviewers to obtain the evidence for this review: 1) the potential risk factors for pneumonia were identified as the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens, dental decay, and poor oral hygiene in five studies; 2) a weak association between periodontal disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was identified in four poor to fair studies; and 3) 10 studies were retained providing evidence that interventions aiming to improve oral health reduced the progression or occurrence of pneumonia. Conclusions: 1) There is fair evidence (II-2, grade B recommendation) of an association of pneumonia with oral health (odds ratio [OR] = 1.2 to 9.6 depending on oral health indicators). 2) There is poor evidence of a weak association (OR {$<$}2.0) between COPD and oral health (II-2/3, grade C recommendation). 3) There is good evidence (I, grade A recommendation) that improved oral hygiene and frequent professional oral health care reduces the progression or occurrence of respiratory diseases among high-risk elderly adults living in nursing homes and especially those in intensive care units (ICUs) (number needed to treat [NNT] = 2 to 16; relative risk reduction [RRR] = 34\% to 83\%).},

Moreover, a drop in average molecular weight occurred in samples (with the exception of potato starch) as a result of main chain scission. The variations in the properties of investigated specimens of various origin were related to the differences in their structure and macromolecular arrangement.

  abstract = {Dental calculus is increasingly used by researchers to study dietary patterns in past populations. The benefits of using dental calculus for this purpose have been clearly demonstrated in previous studies, with dental calculus harbouring a wealth of microremains and biomarkers for health and diet within its mineral matrix. Previous studies have demonstrated some of the limitations and biases of how methods of processing may overlook, or even remove, some of the important information contained within the mineralised matrix. However, there are many factors that are impossible to account for *in vivo* and in archaeological material, such as exact dietary intake, and individual factors such as pH and enzyme activity, leaving some limitations that may not be addressed through these types of studies and will require a different approach. We present a protocol for creating a calcifying oral biofilm model that can be used to explore the biases and limitations of dental calculus as a medium for paleodietary reconstructions. We report the microbial and mineral composition of our model in an effort to validate the model calculus as an appropriate proxy to natural dental calculus. The microbial profile and species diversity of our model was determined using metagenomic classification with the nf-core/eager pipeline and Kraken2, and compared to various reference samples from oral sites, including saliva, plaque, and dental calculus. We then assessed whether our model calculus mineralises in a manner similar to natural dental calculus using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The metagenomic classification showed a microbial profile predominantly made up of (facultative) anaerobes, with a community structure that was somewhat distinct from other oral reference samples. The core genera of the model consisted of oral species, but clustered separately from oral reference samples, with a higher abundance of anaerobes. Mineral and organic components of our model mimic that of the modern and archaeological reference calculus that was used as a comparison. There was an overall increase in the inorganic component relative to organic over the course of the experiment, with carbonated hydroxyapatite as the principal compound, consistent with natural human-derived calculus. We conclude that oral biofilm models, such as the one presented in this study, have great potential to validate current methods used in the analysis of archaeological dental calculus, and should be used to complement, rather than replace current *in vivo* studies.},

  abstract = {Sex estimation is an important part of creating a biological profile for skeletal remains in forensics. The commonly used methods for developing sex estimation equations are discriminant function analysis (DFA) and logistic regression (LogR). LogR equations provide a probability of the predicted sex, while DFA relies on cutoff points to segregate males and females, resulting in a rigid dichotomization of the sexes. This is problematic because sexual dimorphism exists along a continuum and there can be considerable overlap in trait expression between the sexes. In this study, we used humeral measurements to compare the performance of DFA and LogR and found them to be very similar under multiple conditions. The overall cross-validated (leave-one-out) accuracy of DFA (75.76\textendash 95.14\%) was slightly higher than LogR (75.76\textendash 93.82\%) for simple and multiple variable equations, and also performed better under varying sample sizes (94.03\% vs. 93.78\%). Three of five DFA equations outperformed LogR under the B index, while all five LogR equations outperformed the DFA equations under the Q index. Both methods saw an improvement in overall accuracy (DFA: 86.74\textendash 95.79\%; LogR: 86.74\textendash 95.76\%) when individuals with a classification probability lower than 0.80 were excluded. Additionally, we propose a method for calculating additional cutoff points (PMarks) based on posterior probability values. In conclusion, we recommend using LogR over DFA due to the increased flexibility, robusticity, and benefits for future users of the statistical models; however, if DFA is preferred, use of the proposed PMarks facilitates future analysis while avoiding unnecessary dichotomization.},

The stage-based method is derived from degrees of dental wear in known-age (n~=~39) and estimated-age (n~=~11) nonadults containing 951 teeth from the predominately 19th century cemetery of Middenbeemster, The Netherlands. The need for such a method is warranted in cases where dental development and/or eruption cannot be assessed for age-at-death estimation. As well, by establishing a baseline for normal age-related nonadult tooth wear, users may better document wear that could be due to extramasticatory behaviours. The regression analysis reveals a strong quadratic correlation\textemdash F(2, 47)~=~555.1, p~{$<~$}.001, R2~=~.95, standard error of the estimate~=~1.14, residual sum of squares (RSS)~=~68.89, predicted residual error sum of squares (PRESS)~=~77.67\textemdash between age and wear and multivariate adaptive regression splines (R2~=~.95, generalised cross validation~=~1.67, RSS~=~67.68, PRESS~=~89.34), which are used to develop an R-package that users may employ to estimate age-at-death from dental wear. The accuracy of this method (78\textendash 98\%) is evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Analyses of males versus females, deciduous versus permanent, upper versus lower, and anterior versus posterior teeth revealed no apparent reason to warrant separate methods for these groups of separated dentitions. This method fills a disciplinary gap in the understudied area of deciduous and nonadult dental wear and hopes to stimulate much future research. With the R-package, we also provide the foundation and framework for the development of additional reference populations across different spatiotemporal contexts, to make the method more widely applicable.}

  abstract = {Dental calculus is an excellent source of information on the dietary patterns of past populations, including consumption of plant-based items. The detection of plant-derived residues such as alkaloids and their metabolites in dental calculus provides direct evidence of consumption by individuals within a population. We conducted a study on 41 individuals from Middenbeemster, a 19th century rural Dutch archaeological site. Skeletal and dental analysis was performed to explore potential relationships between pathological conditions/lesions and the presence of alkaloids. We also explored other factors potentially affecting the detection of alkaloids, including sample weight and skeletal preservation. Dental calculus was sampled and analysed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS). We were able to detect nicotine, cotinine, caffeine, theophylline, and salicylic acid. By detecting these compounds we are able to show the consumption of tea and coffee and smoking of tobacco on an individual scale, which is also confirmed by historic documentation and identification of pipe notches in the dentition. Nicotine and/or cotinine was present in 60\% of individuals with at least one visible pipe notch. We find some influence of skeletal preservation on the detection of alkaloids and salicylic acid, with higher quantities of compounds extracted from well-preserved individuals, and also observe a relationship between weight of the calculus sample and raw quantity of the detected compounds, and we were able to detect alkaloids in samples as small as 2 mg. We found correlations between chronic maxillary sinusitis and the presence of multiple alkaloids.We show that there are many limitations that will need to be addressed going forward with this type of analysis, and stress the need for more systematic research on the consumption of alkaloid-containing items and their subsequent concentration and preservation in dental calculus, in addition to how mode of consumption may affect concentrations on different parts of the dentition. Despite the limitations, this preliminary study illustrates the many benefits of using calculus to target a variety of compounds that could have been ingested as medicine or diet, or consumed in a different manner. This method allows us to directly address specific individuals, which can be especially useful in individuals that are not always well-documented in historic documentation, such as rural populations, children and women.},

We describe a method to quantify dental macrowear progression (in both deciduous and permanent molars) using a handheld intraoral scanner and two 3D occlusal topographic measurements. We assess the agreement of our macrowear proxies with an established qualitative wear scoring system and their relationship to age. Material and methods We scanned 92 well-preserved dentitions of immature individuals from the medieval cemetery of St. P\"olten in Lower Austria using an intraoral scanner. Two measurements were made on the resulting mesh files\textemdash the relative flat surface area in \% of the occlusal surface (RFSA\%) and the mesial interior slope angle. We estimated the technical error of measurement (TEM). Comparisons were made with the macrowear scoring system\textemdash tooth wear index. Results We found that TEM for both measurements was between 1 and 3\%, except the interobserver TEM of RFSA\% which was above 5\%. Both quantitative measurements generally agree with the established qualitative scores and correlate with age; however, RFSA\% does not reliably indicate the progression of macrowear for teeth after dentine exposure occurs. Discussion The proposed 3D topographic measurements can be made reliably, and within a certain range of wear provide good quantitative proxies of the progression of dental macrowear. Such measurements constitute a promising approach for improving dental macrowear analysis in contexts such as childhood paleodietary reconstruction, which benefit from additional precision in wear rate estimation and present less dentine exposure.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to establish and identify a community of oral bacteria that controls the growth of Candida albicans in the chemostat. The chemostat was operated under glucose-limiting conditions at a dilution rate of 0.05 h-1 and inoculated with a yeast-free suspension of a tongue scraping. After a steady state had been reached, it was inoculated with C. albicans to establish the yeast and determine whether its growth could be contained. The steady-state community comprised the species Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mitis, Lacto-bacillus casei, Eubacterium saburreum, Veillonella dispar and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Bacteroides gracilus and Haemophilus segnis were also detected but infrequently. Yeast growth was suppressed and yeast cells were lost at the same rate as the theoretical washout rate. It is concluded that this mixed community of oral bacteria can be used to identify the parameters that maintain the equilibrium between oral bacteria and C. albicans in the oral cavity.},

  abstract = {(Z)-4-undecenal (Z4-11Al) is the volatile pheromone produced by females of the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster. Female flies emit Z4-11Al for species-specific communication and mate-finding. A sensory panel finds that synthetic Z4-11Al has a characteristic flavour, which can be perceived even at the small amounts produced by a single female fly. Since only females produce Z4-11Al, and not males, we can reliably distinguish between single D. melanogaster males and females, according to their scent. Females release Z4-11Al at 2.4~ng/h and we readily sense 1~ng synthetic Z4-11Al in a glass of wine (0.03~nmol/L), while a tenfold concentration is perceived as a loud off-flavour. This corroborates the observation that a glass of wine is spoilt by a single D. melanogaster fly falling into it, which we here show is caused by Z4-11Al. The biological role of Z4-11Al or structurally related aldehydes in humans and the basis for this semiochemical convergence remains yet unclear.},

  abstract = {Commingled assemblages of fragmentary human skeletal remains are a common feature of many archaeological sites and pose significant analytical problems for bioarchaeologists. Such deposits often contain a high volume of the teeth of subadults for which it is challenging to estimate age, including developing permanent teeth with damaged roots, articulated teeth with roots obscured by alveolar bone, and deciduous teeth with completed root apices. Here, we present a new method for more precisely estimating age for the developmentally ambiguous teeth of subadults from archaeological contexts. We used a sample of articulated subadult dentition from the Copper Age site of Marroqu\'ies in Ja\'en, Spain, to build linear models of the relationship between dental age and tooth wear for deciduous and permanent molars. We tested three different strategies for identifying and removing outliers to build a linear model with the strongest relationship between age and wear. The Adjusted Residual strategy, which used diagnostic plots of linear regression residuals in the statistical package R to identify and remove outliers, was found to produce the strongest linear model. The linear model developed using the Adjusted Residual strategy was then used to provide estimated midpoint ages and upper and lower age bounds based on the wear scores from the sample of developmentally ambiguous teeth. This study demonstrates that it is possible to estimate the age of developmentally ambiguous deciduous and permanent molars with reference to an adequate sample of subadult dentition with estimated ages from the same population. This new method is valuable as it extracts information from developmentally ambiguous teeth that would otherwise be inaccessible, allows for rapid data collection, employs standard macroscopic dental scoring methods, and can be used for sites from other regions and periods. We conclude by discussing the applications of this new method within bioarchaeology and identify directions for future research on subadult dental wear.},

AD) and Vicenne-Campochiaro (VII c. AD) in the Molise region of central Italy. The aim was to determine if the Roman Imperial Age-Early Middle Ages transition characterized by political, socioeconomic, and cultural transformations affected the biology of these populations, particularly their alimentation and health status. The frequencies of caries and AMTL, similar in the two samples, suggest a high consumption of carbohydrates. The higher levels of heavy wear, calculus, and interproximal chipping in the Vicenne population indicate a greater use of fibrous foods (both meat and others), in line with the dietary model of Germanic peoples. Health conditions do not appear to have been good in either period, as shown by the high frequencies of linear hypoplasia and the presence of cribra orbitalia and periostitis. The diet of the individuals buried with horses of the Vicenne population did not differ from that of the rest of the population, whereas there were evident differences in the use of the teeth for nonmasticatory activities among these individuals. Therefore, from the point of view of alimentation and health status, the profound socioeconomic and cultural transformations during the Late Antiquity-Early Middle Ages transition do not seem to have been translated into a true discontinuity of the two Molisan populations.

In Experiment I, eight men have been submitted to four successive body positions for 15 min each, first naked then clothed. Experiment II involved 11 postal employees working in a standing position for 90 min continuously. Experiment III involved 11 bus drivers and a 90 min period of continuous driving. Outcome parameters were left and right scrotal temperatures.In Experiment I, mean values and kinetics of scrotal temperature differed significantly in the naked and clothed state. In all three experiments, left scrotal temperature in the clothed state was higher than right scrotal temperature in terms of mean values and temperature kinetics.Lack of thermal symmetry was seen in the right and left scrotum, whether naked or clothed, and this applied regardless of position or activity when clothed. This thermal difference between right and left scrotum could contribute to the asymmetry in the male external genital organs.}

If the filling was done when the person was still alive, the intervention was likely aimed to relieve tooth sensitivity derived from either exposed dentine and/or the pain resulting from chewing on a cracked tooth: this would provide the earliest known direct evidence of therapeutic-palliative dental filling.}

The temporal evolution of the radial distribution functions derived from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of Ca2+, PO43- and OH--containing aqueous solutions in the presence and absence of B-DNA has been used to conclude that the backbone of the double helix acts as a template for HAp growth. More specifically, results reveal the formation of calcium phosphate clusters at the first stages of the simulations, which subsequently re-organize to nucleate HAp. This effect is produced in the absence and, especially, presence, of DNA indicating that the biomolecules do not inhibit but even promote mineral growth. Furthermore, computer simulations suggest that the diffusion of the OH- anions through the inorganic solution is the limiting step for the nucleation of the biomineral. Nanocapsules and crystalline nanorods of HAp containing DNA molecules inside have been prepared by mixing solutions containing Ca2+ and PO43- ions with fish sperm DNA at high pH. The dimensions and morphology of such nanostructures have been examined by transmission electron microscopy, while the characterization of the biomineral has been focused on the identification of DNA inside HAp using infrared, X-ray photoelectron and UV-vis spectroscopies, as well as gel electrophoresis. The biominerals reported in this work are important for biomedical applications requiring the protection of DNA from aggressive environmental conditions.},

The starch in two drum-dried products was less susceptible to salivary amylase digestion in vitro than in the corresponding boiled or pressure-cooked materials. The rate of starch absorption in young rats, as reflected by the plasma glucose levels, was also lower with drum-dried products than with a boiled control. Similarly, the rise in plasma insulin was slower in drum-dried products. In addition to the conditions used during drum-drying, the method of preparation of the pre-cooked product affected starch availability, the rate of hydrolysis in vitro and, especially, the in vivo glucose response, which was higher in products that were drum-dried and then boiled. The fermentability of drum-dried and boiled wheat flour in human dental plaque was similar, resulting in approximately the same pH drop in situ. A novel type of amylose-lipid complex was formed during drum-drying. Under severe drying conditions, the apparent content of dietary fibre in wheat flour increased by about 20\%, due to formation of enzyme-resistant starch.},

Researchers also often claim that users do not read product documentation, although they are often exhorted to `RTFM' (read the field manual). We conducted two sets of studies with users which looked at the issues of both manuals and excess features with common domestic and personal products. The quantitative set was a series of questionnaires administered to 170 people over 7 years. The qualitative set consisted of two 6-month longitudinal studies based on diaries and interviews with a total of 15 participants. We found that manuals are not read by the majority of people, and most do not use all the features of the products that they own and use regularly. Men are more likely to do both than women, and younger people are less likely to use manuals than middle-aged and older ones. More educated people are also less likely to read manuals. Over-featuring and being forced to consult manuals also appears to cause negative emotional experiences. Implications of these findings are discussed.}

Two iterative techniques, proportional fitting procedure and Bayesian, are used to estimate from the reference samples the age distribution of the targets. Due to the random fluctuations of the pattern of aging, both in the reference and target samples, these techniques converge only in expectation toward the true value of a distribution, but not in practice for any particular realization. Nevertheless, these techniques allow the estimation of the average of an age distribution, even if its shape is unknown. Under the hypothesis that the target sample is drawn from a stationary population, this average represents the life expectancy at 20 years (plus 20 years). Using this mean age at death for the adults and the juvenility index at death (D5-14/D20-{$\omega$}), a new set of paleodemographic estimators were derived from 40 archaic life tables. For a hypothesized stable population, they give the life expectancy at birth and at 20 years, and the probability of death at 1 and 5 years. \textcopyright{} 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}

Dental attrition was scored on all permanent molars from the Tirup skeletal sample. Scores were analyzed by means of logistic regression of the probability of having entered a given stage of wear for a given tooth in a way that is very similar to transition analysis. The primary determinant of dental attrition was age at death. In addition to age, the effects of sex, side, and dating were analyzed. In order to assess the homogeneity of the process of wearing teeth down, a third?order polynomial in age?at?death was also fitted to the transition probabilities. It was found that age is the single most important determinant of dental attrition, and that sex or side did not differentiate the rate of attrition. In several transitions, there was evidence of heterogeneity, indicating both random and systematic interpersonal differences in the rate of attrition and an association between the rate of attrition and age?at?death. It was found that attrition proceeded more quickly after AD 1300 than prior to that date. It is suggested that this was due to a possible general deterioration of living conditions in Northern Europe and an increased reliance on grain for food during the first half of the 14th century. The temporal effect on attrition rate accounts for some but not all the observed heterogeneity wear. Am J Phys Anthropol 126:169?176, 2005. ? 2004 Wiley?Liss, Inc.},

The ages of juvenile skeletons can usually be estimated with minimal bias and an acceptable range of error, although even this endeavor is not entirely free from problems. But the situation is far worse when one is dealing with the skeletons of adults. Here a number of serious osteological and statistical problems plague the process of estimating an individual's age-at-death (see Bocquet-Appel and Masset 1982; Boldsen 1988; Masset 1989; Jackes 1992, 2000; Konigsberg and Frankenberg 1992, 1994; Milner et al. 2000). Among these difficulties is the tendency of age estimates to mimic the structure of the known-age reference samples used as standards of calibration (a problem often called ``age mimicry'') and an inability to estimate the ages of older skeletons (those greater than about 50 years of age).The Rostock protocol outlined in the present volume represents a step toward a solution of these problems. In particular, the strategy of estimating the entire age-at-death distribution f(a) before trying to estimate the age of any individual skeleton is an important, if at first somewhat counterintuitive, innovation. However, the strategy has one serious practical shortcoming: the target population has to be large enough to provide good estimates of f(a). Many archaeological skeletal samples examined by paleodemographers are simply too few in number to proceed in this manner.},

Very little palaeopathological work on this disease has been carried out, probably because of the enclosed nature of the sinuses in intact skulls and the lack of a suitable method for examination. This study tested the hypothesis that maxillary sinusitis was more common in people with leprosy than in people without it in Medieval England. The prevalence of maxillary sinusitis by age and sex was recorded in 133 individuals, some diagnosed as being leprous, derived from a later Medieval (12th to 17th centuries AD) urban hospital population at Chichester, Sussex, England using both macroscopic and endoscopic methods of examination. Of the 133 individuals with one or both sinuses available for examination, 54.9\% (73) had evidence of bone change within the sinuses. There was no difference in prevalence between those with leprosy and those without, although clinical studies suggest that over 50\% of lepromatous leprous individuals may develop sinusitis. Comparison with another study on Medieval British sites with a 3.6\% prevalence (3 of 83) indicates that the prevalence at Chichester is much greater. The problems with diagnosing sinusitis are addressed and reasons behind the high frequency in this study are discussed. Aetiological factors predisposing to maxillary sinusitis are considered with reference to possible environmental conditions prevailing in the later Medieval period in Britain. \textcopyright{} 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Upon swallowing, the bolus moves to the stomach and undergoes further breakdown during gastric digestion. The subject of this review is the formation of the food bolus and its subsequent breakdown in the stomach. Bolus formation has been widely studied, especially in terms of food particle size and lubrication. However, information about bolus disintegration is limited, and this review focuses on the breakdown of bread and starch-based foods. Bolus formation and disintegration are key steps in the overall digestion process, as they control the rate at which ingested food components and nutrients are absorbed and released into the body. Information on the rate kinetics of bolus disintegration is necessary in developing a quantitative understanding of the food digestion process.},

The Standards, Precautions, and Advances in Ancient Metagenomics community (SPAAM, https://spaam-community.github.io) has previously published AncientMetagenomeDir, a collection of curated and standardised sample metadata tables for metagenomic and microbial genome datasets generated from ancient samples. However, while sample-level information is useful for identifying relevant samples for inclusion in new projects, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) library construction and sequencing metadata are also essential for appropriately reprocessing ancient metagenomic data. Currently, recovering information for downloading and preparing such data is difficult when laboratory and bioinformatic metadata is heterogeneously recorded in prose-based publications.\&nbsp; Methods : Through a series of community-based hackathon events, AncientMetagenomeDir was updated to provide standardised library-level metadata of existing and new ancient metagenomic samples. In tandem, the companion tool 'AMDirT' was developed to facilitate automated metadata curation and data validation, as well as rapid data filtering and downloading.\&nbsp; Results : AncientMetagenomeDir was extended to include standardised metadata of over 5000 ancient metagenomic libraries. The companion tool 'AMDirT' provides both graphical- and command-line interface based access to such metadata for users from a wide range of computational backgrounds. We also report on errors with metadata reporting that appear to commonly occur during data upload and provide suggestions on how to improve the quality of data sharing by the community. Conclusions : Together, both standardised metadata and tooling will help towards easier incorporation and reuse of public ancient metagenomic datasets into future analyses.},

Here, we discuss recent advances on the role of the biofilm matrix and interactions between opportunistic pathogens and commensals in the pathogenesis of dental caries.

The resulting data can be used to reconstruct diet at the individual and population levels as the identification of microfossils like starch grains and phytoliths to the generic level, and sometimes to the species level, is possible. However, in some archaeological sites, dental calculus deposits do not preserve well enough to be processed. To prevent the loss of information in such cases, we present a technique, called ``dental wash''. It permits extracting microfossils from cryptic dental calculus deposits. In the two experimental archaeological cases presented herein we identified phytoliths, starch grains as well as a diatom fragment with this method, whereas in a control sample no microfossils were found. Moderate damage to the teeth was detected when they were already friable due to poor preservation. Minor damage to the surface of well-preserved teeth was observed. This indicates that the proposed method is efficient in recovering microfossils, but unacceptable because of damage to teeth. If the method can be refined, it will expand the potential of dental calculus analysis to a greater range of archeological sites.},

Similar complexes were absent from the noncalcifying bacterium Actinomyces naeshmdii. The majority of the Ca-PL-P complexes were associated with the proteolipid acidic phospholipid component. Ca-PL-P complexes isolated from B. matruchotii and from calcified proteolipid contained phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-diphosphate, and phosphatidylserine. They consisted of approximately 52 mole \% Ca, 32 mole \% organic P, and 15 mole \% P\textasciitilde. During Ca-PL-P extraction from B. matruchotii or its proteolipid-containing calcified lipid extracts, the proteolipid was dissociated and the apoprotein precipitated as fluff at the aqueousorganic solvent interface, thus explaining the failure to detect protein in Ca-PL-P preparations. When the ability of Ca-PL-P complexes and lipid fractions of B. matruchotii to initiate apatite formation from metastable calcium phosphate solution was compared, the yield of hydroxyapatite decreased as follows: Ca-PL-P {$>$} proteolipid acidic phospholipids {$>$} proteolipid {$>$} crude phospholipid {$>$} total lipids {$>$} whole cells.},

Both of these membrane constituents, which support apatite formation in vitro, have been isolated independently from Bacterionema matruchotii. However, isolation of proteolipid was preceded by demineralization in 2N formic acid, thereby dissociating bound Ca, whereas isolation of CPLX included sonication of calcified bacteria in 2: l: 1.5 chloroform:methanol:Tris buffer, thereby dissociating any protein. Co-isolation is possible by demineralizing the calcified bacteria with 50 mM phthalic acid, pH 5.5, followed by extraction with 2:1 chloroform:methanol, and precipitation of crude phospholipid with acetone. CPLX and proteolipid are present in all Sephadex LH-20 chromatographic fractions of the crude phospholipid and of diethyl ether precipitates of the crude phospholipid. CPLXs contain protein:phospholipid:Ca:Pi but differ in relative composition from each other and from independently isolated CPLX. The Ca:phospholipid:Pi molar ratio of diethyl ether precipitable proteolipidCPLX is most similar to previously published values for CPLX. The protein content of CPLX accounts for all of the proteolipid apoprotein in each Sephadex LH-20 fraction.},

Although usually black on both the outside and inside, the physical and chemical properties differ as a function of temperature and time of exposure to a heat source. Post-depositional processes however may exert additional affects on charcoalified material and introduce bias into the archaeological record. This work explores the influence of alkaline conditions, often encountered in the soil environment, on the preservation potential of charcoalified material. Charcoal, experimentally produced at different temperatures, was exposed to a number of solutions of potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide with different pHs, to simulate exposure to alkaline soil conditions. Under these conditions chemically mediated physical interactions occur resulting in fragmentation of the charcoal samples into (very) small pieces the size of which depends upon the initial temperature of charcoalification. Moreover further interactions result in a decrease in reflectance relative to samples not exposed to alkaline conditions. Although experimentally driven the potential for physical loss of charcoal from a particular site coupled with the reduction in (expected) reflectance of any resident material, has important implications for any conclusions drawn regarding the archaeological record.},

Many theoretical models of biofilm growth dynamics have been proposed; however, difficulties in accurately measuring biofilm height across relevant time and length scales have prevented testing these models, or their biophysical underpinnings, empirically. Using white light interferometry, we measure the heights of microbial colonies with nanometer precision from inoculation to their final equilibrium height, producing a detailed empirical characterization of vertical growth dynamics. We propose a heuristic model for vertical growth dynamics based on basic biophysical processes inside a biofilm: diffusion and consumption of nutrients and growth and decay of the colony. This model captures the vertical growth dynamics from short to long time scales (10 min to 14 d) of diverse microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi.}

CE) and using diet and origin as proxies, we follow a multi-isotopic approach to reconstruct life histories of patients and investigate how leprosy affected both institutionalized individuals and the medieval Danish community as a whole. Materials and Methods We combine archaeology, historical sources, biological anthropology, isotopic analyses ({$\delta$}13C, {$\delta$}15N, {$\delta$}34S, 87Sr/86Sr) and radiocarbon dating, and further analyze bones with different turnover rates (ribs and long bones). Results The {$\delta$}13C, {$\delta$}15N and {$\delta$}34S results indicate a C3 terrestrial diet with small contributions of marine protein for leprosy patients and individuals from other medieval Danish sites. A similar diet is seen through time, between males and females, and patients with and without changes on facial bones. The isotopic comparison between ribs and long bones reveals no significant dietary change. The {$\delta$}34S and 87Sr/86Sr results suggest that patients were local to the regions of the leprosaria. Moreover, the radiocarbon dates show a mere 50\% agreement with the arm position dating method used in Denmark. Conclusions A local origin for the leprosy patients is in line with historical evidence, unlike the small dietary contribution of marine protein. Although only 10\% of the analyzed individuals have rib/long bone offsets that undoubtedly show a dietary shift, the data appear to reveal a pattern for 25 individuals (out of 50), with elevated {$\delta$}13C and/or {$\delta$}15N values in the ribs compared to the long bones, which points toward a communal type of diet and reveals organizational aspects of the institution.},

However, current laboratory procedures may affect the recovery of microremains and this issue has not been thoroughly investigated. This study involved the analysis of dental calculus from five Chalcolithic individuals from El Mirador cave (Sierra de Atapuerca, Spain) from a methodological perspective. Two sample processing protocols published in the archeological literature were used for this purpose, and results were compared to the El Mirador archaeobotanical record published elsewhere. Analyzed as a whole, the microremains found in the dental calculus samples are consistent with a population immersed in a farming economy, although they are not representative of the richness of the archaeobotanical record of the site. Furthermore, the two protocols delivered different results, in terms of the number of microremains identified, the time required for analysis, and associated contamination problems. This data indicates that the method selected may affect the results. We recommend further research using a larger sample set to fully understand how methodological factors affect the preservation and observation of microremains embedded in dental calculus. We also call for a discussion on the role of dental calculus in archeological research.},

Anthropol. 68:15\textendash 28), but the revised technique is easier to apply, and has low levels of inter- and intraobserver error. The new method records age-related stages for different features of the auricular surface, which are then combined to provide a composite score from which an estimate of age at death is obtained. Blind tests of the method were carried out on a known-age skeletal collection from Christ Church, Spitalfields, London. These tests showed that the dispersion of age at death for a given morphological stage was large, particularly after the first decade of adult life. Statistical analysis showed that the age-related changes in auricular surface are not significantly different for males and females. The scores from the revised method have a slightly higher correlation with age than do the Suchey-Brooks pubic symphysis stages. Considering the higher survival rates of the auricular surface compared with the pubic symphysis, this method promises to be useful for biological anthropology and forensic science.

Here we present a suite of results from the multi-period Central Sudanese site of Al Khiday. We demonstrate the ingestion in both pre-agricultural and agricultural periods of Cyperus rotundus tubers. This plant is a good source of carbohydrates and has many useful medicinal and aromatic qualities, though today it is considered to be the world's most costly weed. Its ability to inhibit Streptococcus mutans may have contributed to the unexpectedly low level of caries found in the agricultural population.

Bacterial composition may be affected by age, oral health, diet, and geography, although information about the natural variation found in the general public is still lacking. In this study, citizen-scientists used a crowdsourcing model to obtain oral bacterial composition data from guests at the Denver Museum of Nature \& Science to determine if previously suspected oral microbiome associations with an individual's demographics, lifestyle, and/or genetics are robust and generalizable enough to be detected within a general population. Consistent with past research, we found bacterial composition to be more diverse in youth microbiomes when compared to adults. Adult oral microbiomes were predominantly impacted by oral health habits, while youth microbiomes were impacted by biological sex and weight status. The oral pathogen               Treponema               was detected more commonly in adults without recent dentist visits and in obese youth. Additionally, oral microbiomes from participants of the same family were more similar to each other than to oral microbiomes from non-related individuals. These results suggest that previously reported oral microbiome associations are observable in a human population containing the natural variation commonly found in the general public. Furthermore, these results support the use of crowdsourced data as a valid methodology to obtain community-based microbiome data.},

A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.Results: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows\textendash Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is {$\sim$}10\textendash 20\texttimes{} faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.Availability:http://maq.sourceforge.netContact:rd@sanger.ac.uk}

This biomineralization process reproduces, to some extent, the original plant tissue in the form of microscopic particles that are incorporated into soils and sediments when the plant dies and decays. Phytoliths' inorganic nature makes them resistant to most pre- and post-depositional processes, including fire, and they can preserve over long periods in a different range of conditions. However, not all plants produce the same amount of phytoliths and phytolith morphologies can be redundant, impeding the identification of the original plant tissue. Phytolith assemblages can also suffer post-depositional processes that might affect their preservation and bias the interpretation.

  abstract = {Quantification of dental long-period growth lines (Retzius lines in enamel and Andresen lines in dentine) and matching of stress patterns (internal accentuated lines and hypoplasias) are used in determining crown formation time and age at death in juvenile fossil hominins. They yield the chronology employed for inferences of life history. Synchrotron virtual histology has been demonstrated as a non-destructive alternative to conventional invasive approaches. Nevertheless, fossil teeth are sometimes poorly preserved or physically inaccessible, preventing observation of the external expression of incremental lines (perikymata and periradicular bands). Here we present a new approach combining synchrotron virtual histology and high quality three-dimensional rendering of dental surfaces and internal interfaces. We illustrate this approach with seventeen permanent fossil hominin teeth. The outer enamel surface and enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) were segmented by capturing the phase contrast fringes at the structural interfaces. Three-dimensional models were rendered with Phong's algorithm, and a combination of directional colored lights to enhance surface topography and the pattern of subtle variations in tissue density. The process reveals perikymata and linear enamel hypoplasias on the entire crown surface, including unerupted teeth. Using this method, highly detailed stress patterns at the EDJ allow precise matching of teeth within an individual's dentition when virtual histology is not sufficient. We highlight that taphonomical altered enamel can in particular cases yield artificial subdivisions of perikymata when imaged using X-ray microtomography with insufficient resolution. This may complicate assessments of developmental time, although this can be circumvented by a careful analysis of external and internal structures in parallel. We further present new crown formation times for two unerupted canines from South African Australopiths, which were found to form over a rather surprisingly long time ({$>$} 4.5 years). This approach provides tools for maximizing the recovery of developmental information in teeth, especially in the most difficult cases.},

  abstract = {Dental age assessments are widely used to estimate age of immature skeletal remains. Most methods have relied on fractional stages of tooth emergence and formation, particularly of the permanent dentition, for predicting the age of infants and very young children. In this study, the accuracy of regression equations of developing deciduous tooth length for age estimation (Liversidge et al.) is tested on a sample of 30 Portuguese subadult skeletons of known age at death. Overall the method shows high accuracy and the average difference between estimated and chronological age is between 0.20 and -0.14 years when using single teeth, and 0.06 years, when using all available teeth. However, there is a tendency for the deciduous molars to provide overestimates of chronological age. Results show that age estimates can be obtained within {$\pm$}0.10 years with a 95\% confidence interval when several teeth are used. Overall between-tooth agreement in age estimates decreases with increasing age but there is less variability of estimates with more teeth contributing to overall mean age. One seemingly limitation of this method may be the fact that it was developed by combining the maxillary and mandibular teeth. The other is related to the accuracy with which radiographic tooth length can be used as a valid surrogate for actual tooth length. Nevertheless, the advantages of this metric method surpass the limitations of chronologies based on stages of dental development.},

Chemical analysis of organic residues extracted from archaeological smoking pipes is an encouraging avenue of research into answering questions regarding the development of a smoking complex within indigenous cultures of the Eastern Woodlands. In the right environmental conditions, absorbed organic compounds within artifacts can remain structurally stable for millennia, allowing analyses of organic matter to be performed on relics of advanced age. In this study, organic matter from six pipe fragments derived from the prehistoric Feltus site in Mississippi was extracted and analyzed via GC-MS, a process that allows for the identification of compounds in a complex mixture. Preliminary experiments tested the effects of pH on the efficacy of our extraction solvent to maximize the detectability of alkaloids such as nicotine. Several notable compounds were identified, including nicotine, which serves as a biomarker for tobacco.},

  abstract = {Objective This paper explores dental diseases and wear as a proxy for dietary patterns in Hellenistic-early Roman Menainon. Materials This study includes 166 individuals (4th-1st c. BCE). Methods Carious lesions, dental calculus, antemortem tooth loss, and dental wear were recorded to explore male-female and adult-juvenile differences, and to position Menainon in the broader Hellenistic/early Roman world through comparisons with published data from other sites. Results Males and females showed similar rates of dental diseases. Dental wear, in contrast, was systematically greater in males. Caries rates were high in both adults and juveniles, but adults showed more calculus. The population from Menainon had higher frequencies for calculus and carious lesions compared to contemporary Italian and Greek assemblages, and a similar frequency for antemortem tooth loss. Conclusion Some sex-related differences in the dietary patterns of the Menainon population were visible but small. The diet of adults and juveniles must have been similar in terms of carbohydrate consumption but different with regard to protein consumption. The high frequency of carious lesions and calculus compared to other Greco-Roman sites suggests that this population must have had good access to dietary resources (protein and carbohydrates). Significance This paper provides insights on gender (sex-related) and age divisions in the Hellenistic/early Roman society through the exploration of food consumption in a Sicilian assemblage. Limitations Dividing the assemblage by sex and age group reduced considerably the sample size. Suggestions for further research Stable isotopes and dental microwear analyses should be used to investigate dietary patterns further.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between urbanization and upper respiratory health in two early modern populations from the Netherlands. For this purpose, we analyzed the prevalence of chronic maxillary sinusitis in the adult urban population of Arnhem (n = 83) and in the rural village of Middenbeemster (n = 74). A slightly higher prevalence of chronic maxillary sinusitis was observed in the Arnhem sample (55.4\%) compared with the Middenbeemster sample (51.3\%), and these variations were not statistically significantly different. Although historical sources attest to the fact that life in the postmedieval settlements of Arnhem and Middenbeemster greatly differed, our results suggest that both environments exposed people to certain respiratory hazards. Furthermore, sinusitis prevalence was also investigated in correlation to sex, as urbanization in the Netherlands often involved women in factory work in direct contrast to the traditional domestic role they kept covering in rural environments. No significant differences were observed between males and females, both in an intersite (Arnhem males vs. Middenbeemster males; Arnhem females vs. Middenbeemster females) and in an intrasite (males vs. females at Arnhem; males vs. females at Middenbemster) comparison. As men and women in Arnhem worked on similar tasks, our results confirm that they were both exposed to similar risk factors. In Middenbeemster, where women mainly stayed inside taking care of the house while men worked the fields, the adverse weather conditions and continuous exposure to pollens and allergens may have enhanced men's chances of contracting chronic maxillary sinusitis. This study suggests that urbanization in the early modern Netherlands was in fact not inherently more detrimental than rural living. Future research incorporating a larger sample from other Dutch sites is being considered to better frame the complex etiology of sinusitis within the present understanding of historic regional variation in urbanization patterns.},

Given that environment, health, and evolution are interconnected, we ask: Could diet-driven microbiome perturbations have consequences that extend beyond their immediate impact on human health? We address this question in the context of the urgent health challenges posed by global climate change. Drawing on recent studies, we propose that not only can diet-driven microbiome changes lead to dysbiosis, they can also shape life-history traits and fuel human evolution. We posit that dietary shifts prompt mismatched microbiome-host genetics configurations that modulate human longevity and reproductive success. These mismatches can also induce a heritable intra-holobiont stress response, which encourages the holobiont to re-establish equilibrium within the changed nutritional environment. Thus, while mismatches between climate change-related genetic and epigenetic configurations within the holobiont increase the risk and severity of diseases, they may also affect life-history traits and facilitate adaptive responses. These propositions form a framework that can help systematize and address climate-related dietary challenges for policy and health interventions.},

Adherent bacterial populations (biofilms) present with an innate lack of antibiotic susceptibility not seen in the same bacteria grown as planktonic populations.

The CBD produces 96 equivalent biofilms for the assay of antibiotic susceptibilities by the standard 96-well technology. Biofilm formation was followed by quantitative microbiology and scanning electron microscopy. Susceptibility to a standard group of antibiotics was determined for National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) reference strains:               Escherichia coli               ATCC 25922,               Pseudomonas aeruginosa               ATCC 27853, and               Staphylococcus aureus               ATCC 29213.

The antibiotic susceptibilities for planktonic populations obtained by the NCCLS method or from the CBD were similar. Minimal biofilm eradication concentrations, derived by using the CBD, demonstrated that for biofilms of the same organisms, 100 to 1,000 times the concentration of a certain antibiotic were often required for the antibiotic to be effective, while other antibiotics were found to be effective at the MICs. The CBD offers a new technology for the rational selection of antibiotics effective against microbial biofilms and for the screening of new effective antibiotic compounds.},

Results The mean age of crack cocaine and control groups was 36.89\,{$\pm$}\,7.78 and 35.78\,{$\pm$}\,6.68 years, respectively. 458 salivary proteins were identified in both groups; 305 proteins in the crack cocaine group. Among the 68 proteins presented in both groups, 29 were down-regulated (i.e. ``Statherin'' and ``Transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein ig-h3'' were down-regulated at least 10-fold) and 27 up-regulated (i.e. ``Negative elongation factor'' was up-regulated 19-fold) in the crack cocaine group compared to controls. 90 out of the 458 proteins found in the proteomic analysis were identified as candidates for biomarkers of diseases. Among these, 65 (72.22 \%) were detected in the crack cocaine group. Conclusion Crack cocaine dependents with chronic alcohol and tobacco use have a higher number of proteins in saliva compared to non-drug users. 22.3 \% of salivary proteins present in crack cocaine dependents were present in controls; 3.9 \% of them were expressed in similar quantity.},

Concerns about such behaviours have been raised repeatedly for over half a century [9\textendash 11] but the incentive structure of academia has not changed to address them. Despite the complex motivations that drive academia, many QRPs stem from the simple fact that the incentives which offer success to individual scientists conflict with what is best for science [12]. On the one hand are a set of gold standards that centuries of the scientific method have proven to be crucial for discovery: rigour, reproducibility, and transparency. On the other hand are a set of opposing principles born out of the academic career model: the drive to produce novel and striking results, the importance of confirming prior expectations, and the need to protect research interests from competitors. Within a culture that pressures scientists to produce rather than discover, the outcome is a biased and impoverished science in which most published results are either unconfirmed genuine discoveries or unchallenged fallacies [13]. This observation implies no moral judgement of scientists, who are as much victims of this system as they are perpetrators.},

Metric traits of the long bones of the arm have been reported as reliable indicators of sex. This study was designed to determine whether the three long bones of the arm can be used for sex determination on a skeletal population from Greece. The material used consists of the arm bones of 204 adult individuals (111 males and 93 females) coming from the Modern Human Skeletal Collection of the University of Athens. The age range is 19\textendash 96~years for males and 20\textendash 99~years for females. The maximum lengths and epiphyseal widths were measured in the long bones of the arm (humerus, radius, and ulna). The discriminant analysis of the metrical data of each long bone gave very high discrimination accuracies. The rate of correct sex discrimination based on different long bones ranges from 90.30\% (ulna) to 95.70\% (humerus). In addition, intra- and inter-observer error tests were performed. These indicated that replication of measurements was satisfactory for the same observer over time and between observers. The results of this study show that metric characteristics of the arm bones can be used for the determination of sex in skeletal remains from Greece and that bone dimensions are population specific.}

Two SA concentrations (20\,{$\mu$}M and 200\,{$\mu$}M) were used for comparison. SA was quickly taken up in both treatments, and the 200\,{$\mu$}M-treated cells absorbed approximately 15 times that of 20\,{$\mu$}M-treated cells within 5\,min. More than 85\% and 50\% of the absorbed SA were excreted in free form to the culture medium within 5\,h from cells treated with 200\,{$\mu$}M and 20\,{$\mu$}M SA, respectively. SA excretion was significantly inhibited by EGTA and the inhibition could be reversed by the addition of exogenous Ca2+to the culture medium in the 200\,{$\mu$}M SA treatment. However, EGTA had little or no effect on SA excretion in the 20\,{$\mu$}M SA treatment. The data suggest that tobacco suspension-cultured cells may contain both Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent pathways for SA excretion. Reduced glutathione (an active oxygen species scavenger), staurosporine (a protein kinase inhibitor), and cycloheximide (an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis) also blocked intracellular SA excretion to the culture medium in the 200\,{$\mu$}M but not in the 20\,{$\mu$}M SA treatment. These data support the existence of alternative SA excretion pathways in tobacco suspension-cultured cells. Tobacco cells may use both Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent excretion pathways to cope with different intracellular SA status, and the pathway influenced by EGTA, reduced glutathione, staurosporine, and cycloheximide is activated by SA at 200\,{$\mu$}M, but not at 20\,{$\mu$}M.}

The proposed methods are evaluated via a simulation study and compared via some standard measures of estimation bias and precision. Finally, the methods are illustrated and compared using three real data sets. The simulation and empirical results overall favor both the segmented and Bayesian methods of estimation, which simultaneously estimate the change point and the other model parameters, though only the Bayesian method is able to handle both continuous and dis-continuous change point problems successfully. If it is known that regression lines are continuous then the segmented method ranked first among methods.},

  abstract = {An intuitive, clinically relevant index of microbial dysbiosis as a summary statistic of subgingival microbiome profiles is needed. Here, we describe a subgingival microbial dysbiosis index (SMDI) based on machine learning analysis of published periodontitis/health 16S microbiome data. The raw sequencing data, split into training and test sets, were quality filtered, taxonomically assigned to the species level, and centered log-ratio transformed. The training data set was subject to random forest analysis to identify discriminating species (DS) between periodontitis and health. DS lists, compiled by various ``Gini'' importance score cutoffs, were used to compute the SMDI for samples in the training and test data sets as the mean centered log-ratio abundance of periodontitis-associated species subtracted by that of health-associated ones. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed with receiver operating characteristic analysis. An SMDI based on 49 DS provided the highest accuracy with areas under the curve of 0.96 and 0.92 in the training and test data sets, respectively, and ranged from -6 (most normobiotic) to 5 (most dysbiotic) with a value around zero discriminating most of the periodontitis and healthy samples. The top periodontitis-associated DS were Treponema denticola, Mogibacterium timidum, Fretibacterium spp., and Tannerella forsythia, while Actinomyces naeslundii and Streptococcus sanguinis were the top health-associated DS. The index was highly reproducible by hypervariable region. Applying the index to additional test data sets in which nitrate had been used to modulate the microbiome demonstrated that nitrate has dysbiosis-lowering properties in vitro and in vivo. Finally, 3 genera (Treponema, Fretibacterium, and Actinomyces) were identified that could be used for calculation of a simplified SMDI with comparable accuracy. In conclusion, we have developed a nonbiased, reproducible, and easy-to-interpret index that can be used to identify patients/sites at risk of periodontitis, to assess the microbial response to treatment, and, importantly, as a quantitative tool in microbiome modulation studies.},

Recent discoveries of a host of archaeological sites dating to the proto-Shang culture (4000\textendash 3600~cal BP) have helped elucidate the transition to the Shang culture. Nevertheless, there are few investigations about the mode of subsistence and economy of the proto-Shang culture, and how this might have shaped the transition to statehood. In this present study, we analyzed the starch grains preserved in dental calculus and teeth surfaces from 16 samples from the site of Nancheng in order to gain a better understanding of the subsistence strategy and plant consumption of proto-Shang people. We also performed experiments to test how different cooking methods may lead to size changes in the starches of four Poaceae plants, in order to identify the processing methods used by the proto-Shang people. The results indicate that Triticum aestivum, Coix lacryma-jobi, Setaria italica and some yet-unidentified roots and tubers were consumed by these individuals. These data indicate a broader spectrum of plant consumption than that seen by previous archaeobotanical and stable isotope analyses. Such a broad spectrum of plant consumption provided a substantial economic base for proto-Shang people and might be one of the factors supporting the subsequent development of the Shang state culture.},

Caffeine was isolated from the teas with liquid-liquid extraction and quantitated by gas chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorus detection. Caffeine concentrations in white, green, and black teas ranged from 14 to 61 mg per serving (6 or 8 oz) with no observable trend in caffeine concentration due to the variety of tea. The decaffeinated teas contained less than 12 mg of caffeine per serving, and caffeine was not detected in the herbal tea varieties. In most instances, the 6- and 8-oz serving sizes contained similar caffeine concentrations per ounce, but the steep-time affected the caffeine concentration of the tea.

Macroscopic inspection of the skeleton revealed conspicuous thickening of the tibiae and fibulae with `tree bark' appearance of the cortex. Periosteal proliferations are also found on the calcanea and on the posterior part of the femora. The metatarsals showed bony proliferation and bone dissolution. No alteration of the axial skeleton or the skull was noted. Radiographs showed thickening of the cortex of tubular bones due to a multilayered type of periosteal apposition. The likelihood of these symptoms being the result of melorheostosis, hypervitaminosis A, fluorosis, thyroid acropachy, endosteal hyperostosis, tuberculosis (TB), hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (HOA), treponematosis and leprosy is reviewed. None completely explains the entire spectrum of pathological lesions in the current individual, but the individual may have suffered from two co-existent diseases. As a clinical entity, the changes in the metatarsals are compatible with leprosy, whereas the periosteal proliferations of the lower limbs point to a diagnosis of HOA as a secondary syndrome. Thus, a combination of leprosy and TB is suggested as a potential diagnosis. Although not definitive, our differential diagnosis was able to exclude a number of conditions producing periosteal apposition. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}

Hence, it is important to have an analytical method for the determination of these components in commercial samples. At the same time, it is also important to assess the safety of the product in terms of amount of any psychoactive cannabinoid present therein. This work presents the development and validation of a highly sensitive, selective and rapid HPLC-UV method for the qualitative and quantitative determination of the main cannabinoids, namely cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), cannabidiol (CBD), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabinol (CBN), cannabigerol (CBG) and cannabidivarin (CBDV), present in 13 commercial hemp seed oils. Moreover, since decomposition of cannabinoid acids generally occurs with light, air and heat, decarboxylation studies of the most abundant acid (CBDA) were carried out in both open and closed reactor and the kinetics parameters were evaluated at different temperatures in order to evaluate the stability of hemp seed oil in different storage conditions.},

Its importance for human health is reflected by the success on the market of organic goods in recent years.

In the present work, we analysed the chemical profile of ten commercially available organic hemp seed oils. Their cannabinoid profile was evaluated by a liquid chromatography method coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. Besides tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, other 30 cannabinoids were identified for the first time in hemp seed oil. The results obtained were processed according to an untargeted metabolomics approach. The multivariate statistical analysis showed highly significant differences in the chemical composition and, in particular, in the cannabinoid content of the hemp oils under investigation.},

Cannabis has long been prized for the strong and durable fiber in its stalks, its edible and oil-rich seeds, and the psychoactive and medicinal compounds produced by its female flowers. The culturally valuable and often irreplaceable goods derived from cannabis deeply influenced the commercial, medical, ritual, and religious practices of cultures throughout the ages, and human desire for these commodities directed the evolution of the plant toward its contemporary varieties. As interest in cannabis grows and public debate over its many uses rises, this book will help us understand why humanity continues to rely on this plant and adapts it to suit our needs.},

  abstract = {Bioarchaeologists have long used age estimates from skeletal remains to draw conclusions about past lifeways and sociobiological phenomena such as health, stress, fertility, and frailty, among others. However, the estimation of age from skeletal remains is complicated by a multitude of well-documented challenges including age mimicry, variation in degeneration, preservation, and accuracy between anatomical regions, individuals, and populations. The application of transition analysis to bioarchaeological age estimation was introduced nearly two decades ago to address some of these challenges, and the newest version promise further improvements. However, given the time lag between the introduction of a new technology and its adoption, continued evaluation of existing methods remains important. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of skeletal age-at-death estimation through transition analysis in the reconstruction of population survivorship in 18th century Dublin, Ireland. It was hypothesized that there would be no differences between the survival distributions calculated from 18th-century parish records and survival distributions estimated from skeletal remains rom approximately the same time and location. Results show that survivorship estimated from transition analysis was approximately equal to the survivorship calculated from burial records in early- to mid-adulthood, despite the fact that the samples do not represent the same individuals. However, transition analysis consistently produced higher survival curves in later adulthood, despite the lower socioeconomic statuses of the individuals represented in the skeletal sample relative to the individuals in the burial records, though these differences were not statistically significant for females. These findings suggest that bioarchaeologists should continue to exercise caution when drawing conclusions about populations based on skeletons.},

Seven species were studied as planktonic cells, including Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces naeslundii, and the species mentioned above. The viability of planktonic cells and biofilms was analyzed by susceptibility tests and time-kill assays, respectively, against different concentrations of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine. High-performance liquid chromatography was performed to quantify nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations in the culture media after the assays. Susceptibility tests and viability assays showed that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine cannot reduce or stimulate bacterial growth. High-performance liquid chromatography results showed that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations were not altered after bacteria exposure. These findings indicate that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine, in the concentrations used, cannot affect significantly the growth of these oral bacterial strains. Moreover, these species do not seem to metabolize these substances.},

This paper presents a nutritional template that offers a proxy calorie value for the human body. When applied to the Palaeolithic record, the template provides a framework for assessing the dietary value of prehistoric cannibalistic episodes compared to the faunal record. Results show that humans have a comparable nutritional value to those faunal species that match our typical body weight, but significantly lower than a range of fauna often found in association with anthropogenically modified hominin remains. This could suggest that the motivations behind hominin anthropophagy may not have been purely nutritionally motivated. It is proposed here that the comparatively low nutritional value of hominin cannibalism episodes support more socially or culturally driven narratives in the interpretation of Palaeolithic cannibalism.},

We have simulated collagen diagenesis using a simple conceptual model in which the degradation is controlled by two key processes: (i) depolymerization of collagen by chemical hydrolysis of peptide bonds; and (ii) dissolution (i.e. melting free) of those polypeptide fragments retained by fewer than a critical number of hydrogen bonds, biodeterioration being ignored. The model predicts that the curve describing weight loss is approximately sigmoidal in form, a pattern in accord with the sparse experimental data for non-mineralized collagen. The conclusion from studies of mineralized collagen is that the weight loss curve is exponential (i.e. a first-order reaction), but we argue that the experimental design of those studies was flawed. Other predictions of the model relating to the changing size distribution of residual fragments, N-termini, physical properties and significance of cross-linking are reported. Cross-linking appears to be a particularly significant phenomenon, which causes a marked tailing of the weight loss curve and thus the enhanced preservation of cross-linked, low collagen bone. The validity of applying this simple conceptual model to archaeological collagen is discussed.},

Drug metabolites also can be detected in oral fluid. Unlike urine testing, there may be a close correspondence between drug and metabolite concentrations in oral fluid and in blood. Interpretation of oral fluid results for drugs of abuse should be an iterative process whereby one considers the test results in the context of program requirements and a broad scientific knowledge of the many factors involved in determining test outcome. This review delineates many of the chemical and metabolic processes involved in the disposition of drugs and metabolites in oral fluid that are important to the appropriate interpretation of oral fluid tests. Chemical, metabolic, kinetic, and analytic parameters are summarized for selected drugs of abuse, and general guidelines are offered for understanding the significance of oral fluid tests.},

Starches from different sources show variable chemical composition as well as the structure of their components that are involved in thermal properties. Amylose, lipids, phosphorylated residues and long lateral chain amylopectin interact among them avoiding water uptake. In contrast, high amylopectin contents, especially with short lateral chains, allow hydration via hydrogen bonds to form gels with the tendency to retrogradation. Smaller starch granules have a larger superficial area, surface pores, and channels that enhance water uptake. High hydration increases the swelling, viscosity, and gelatinization ability of starch granules. The knowledge of those properties allows the selection of the most appropriate starch for a specific end use. This review discusses the relationship between the physicochemical composition of the starch and their rheological properties.},

Models using ilium width and module, maximum clavicle length, and lateral vertebral body heights were more than 92\% accurate. Precision was lower for postpubertal individuals.

The method employs collection of oral fluid with the Quantisal\texttrademark{} device, base hydrolysis, solid-phase extraction and LC\textendash MS-MS in positive ion electrospray mode. Because the concentration of the metabolite in oral fluid is quite low, extremely sensitive analytical methods are necessary. The requisite sensitivity was achieved by a simple, rapid derivatization of the compound after extraction. The derivatization conditions did not affect parent THC. The method was fully validated using standard parameters including linearity, sensitivity, accuracy, intra-day and inter-day imprecision, drug recovery from the collection pad, limit of quantitation, limit of detection and matrix effects. The procedure was applied to oral fluid proficiency specimens previously analyzed to assess the stability of THC-COOH.}

To date, several systems have been developed to grow bacterial biofilms in order to study their phenotypes and the physiology of sessile cells. Although relevant, such systems permit analysis of various aspects of the biofilm state but often after several hours of bacterial growth. Results Here we describe a simple and easy-to-use system for growing P. aeruginosa biofilm based on the medium adsorption onto glass wool fibers. This approach which promotes bacterial contact onto the support, makes it possible to obtain in a few minutes a large population of sessile bacteria. Using this growth system, we demonstrated the feasibility of exploring the early stages of biofilm formation by separating by electrophoresis proteins extracted directly from immobilized cells. Moreover, the involvement of protein synthesis in P. aeruginosa attachment is demonstrated. Conclusions Our system provides sufficient sessile biomass to perform biochemical and proteomic analyses from the early incubation period, thus paving the way for the molecular analysis of the early stages of colonization that were inaccessible to date.

  abstract = {Objectives: The objective is to assess topographic distribution of carious lesions (crown and CEJ) by sex and age class and relate it to food intake; Materials and methods: Sixty-eight males and 45 females aged 15 years and older from the Prehispanic Classic period Maya site of Xcamb\'o (AD 250-700) were selected and organized into 15-30 yrs, 31-45 yrs and 46+years age classes. Caries were scored on all permanent teeth based on their location on the crown, interstitial CEJ as well as buccal and lingual CEJ. Results: Caries affected 14.6\% of the permanent teeth in males and 27.7\% in females. About half of all the lesions were located at the mesial and distal CEJ edge of the teeth (50\% in males and 46.6\% in females), while 12.9\% and 17.1\% (respectively for males and females) affected the buccal and lingual CEJ edge. Multiple caries interested 19.7\% of teeth in males and 24.9\% in females. Last AMTL was recorded in 16.4\% of sockets in males and in 27.4\% in females. The overall frequencies of caries and AMTL increase with age at death, and differences by sex are statistically significant; on the contrary, interstitial CEJ, buccal and lingual CEJ and multiple caries do not follow an age-related pattern of distribution, and do not show statistically significant differences between males and females. Discussion and conclusions: The coastal site of Xcamb\'o shows one of the highest frequencies of caries in the region. The high socioeconomic status of the site suggests that caries were not due to a diet based on maize, but that also sugary (honey and various fruits) and starchy foods were ingested on a daily base. Cariogenic sticky foodstuff, which likely triggered caries at the buccal and lingual CEJ edges of the teeth, were ingested by all the members of the society regardless of sex and age.},

The best methods currently available for the sexual diagnosis of human skeletal remains generally rely on the presence of well-preserved pelvic bones, which is not always the case. Postcranial elements, including the femur, have been used to accurately estimate sex in skeletal remains from forensic and bioarcheological settings. In this study, we present an approach to estimate sex using two measurements (femoral neck width [FNW] and femoral neck axis length [FNAL]) of the proximal femur. FNW and FNAL were obtained in a training sample (114 females and 138 males) from the Lu\'is Lopes Collection (National History Museum of Lisbon). Logistic regression and the C4.5 algorithm were used to develop models to predict sex in unknown individuals. Proposed cross-validated models correctly predicted sex in 82.5\textendash 85.7\% of the cases. The models were also evaluated in a test sample (96 females and 96 males) from the Coimbra Identified Skeletal Collection (University of Coimbra), resulting in a sex allocation accuracy of 80.1\textendash 86.2\%. This study supports the relative value of the proximal femur to estimate sex in skeletal remains, especially when other exceedingly dimorphic skeletal elements are not accessible for analysis.},

  abstract = {The last decade has witnessed unparalleled advances in our understanding of the complexity of the oral microbiome and the compositional changes that occur in subgingival biofilms in the transition from health to gingivitis and to destructive periodontal disease. The traditional view, which has held sway for the last 2 decades, that disease is characterized by the outgrowth of a consortium, or consortia, of a limited number of potentially pathogenic organisms, has given way to an alternative paradigm. In this new view, the microbiological changes associated with disease represent whole-scale alterations to the overall microbial population structure and to the functional properties of the entire community. Thus, and in common with other microbially mediated diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, the normally balanced, symbiotic, and generally benign commensal microbiome of the tooth-associated biofilm undergoes dysbiosis to a potentially deleterious microbiota. Coincident with progress in defining the microbiology of these diseases, there have been equally important advances in our understanding of the inflammatory systems of the periodontal tissues, their control, and how inflammation may contribute both to the development of dysbiosis and, in a deregulated state, the destructive disease process. One can therefore speculate that the inflammatory response and the periodontal microbiome are in a bidirectional balance in oral health and a bidirectional imbalance in periodontitis. However, despite these clear insights into both sides of the host/microbe balance in periodontal disease, there remain several unresolved issues concerning the role of the microbiota in disease. These include, but are not limited to, the factors which determine progression from gingivitis to periodontitis in a proportion of the population, whether dysbiosis causes disease or results from disease, and the molecular details of the microbial stimulus responsible for driving the destructive inflammatory response. Further progress in resolving these issues may provide significant benefit to diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.},

Flavonoids are a family of plant-derived compounds with potentially exploitable activities, including direct antibacterial activity, synergism with antibiotics, and suppression of bacterial virulence. In this review, recent advances towards understanding these properties are described. Information is presented on the ten most potently antibacterial flavonoids as well as the five most synergistic flavonoid\textendash antibiotic combinations tested in the last 6 years (identified from PubMed and ScienceDirect). Top of these respective lists are panduratin A, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.06\textendash 2.0{$\mu$}g/mL against Staphylococcus aureus, and epicatechin gallate, which reduces oxacillin MICs as much as 512-fold. Research seeking to improve such activity and understand structure\textendash activity relationships is discussed. Proposed mechanisms of action are also discussed. In addition to direct and synergistic activities, flavonoids inhibit a number of bacterial virulence factors, including quorum-sensing signal receptors, enzymes and toxins. Evidence of these molecular effects at the cellular level include in vitro inhibition of biofilm formation, inhibition of bacterial attachment to host ligands, and neutralisation of toxicity towards cultured human cells. In vivo evidence of disruption of bacterial pathogenesis includes demonstrated efficacy against Helicobacter pylori infection and S. aureus {$\alpha$}-toxin intoxication.},

The presence of the os coxae or skull can never be guaranteed, making the development of reliable methods of sex estimation using other skeletal elements necessary. Using a 724 individual calibration sample from the Hamann-Todd collection, this study identifies sexual dimorphism in the human scapula, and presents a new five-variable discriminant function for sex estimation. The overall accuracy of this method proved to be 95.7\% on the cross-validated calibration sample, 92.5\% on an 80 individual test sample from the Hamann-Todd collection, and 84.4\% on a 32 individual test sample from the skeletal collection of the Wichita State University Biological Anthropology Laboratory. Additionally, a slightly less accurate two-variable model was developed and has cross-validated accuracy of 91.3\%.}

Excavations in the predynastic to early dynastic necropolis of Adaima, Upper Egypt (3500\textendash 2700 BC) led to the discovery of a number of remarkably well-preserved skeletons of children. The skeletal remains of a 4.5\textendash 5-year-old child dated from Nagada III A2 (3200\textendash 3100 BC) displayed various lesions on the post-cranial skeleton: spondylitis on the thoracic (T12) and lumbar (L1) vertebrae, partial lytic destruction of the right radio-ulnar joint, lytic lesions on the scapula and a clavicle, dactylitis on the short bones of hands and feet, enlargement (spina ventosa) and periosteal new bone formation on the long bones. Radiographs show well-defined radiolucent (cyst-like) lesions in the metaphysis and the diaphysis of long tubular bones (ulna, radius, femur, tibia, fibula). The lesions recorded during macroscopic and radiological analysis strongly suggest a case of multiple bone tuberculosis. The occurrence of this case of tuberculosis in a child provides a picture of a period where tuberculosis must have been endemic throughout the population living during the origins of urban settlement in Upper Egypt during the predynastic period.

Saliva samples were analysed by culture and approximal supragingival plaque samples were analysed with the DNA\textendash DNA hybridization method (`checkerboard'). Results. Among the 100 children, mean DMFS was 3.43 [standard deviation (SD) 2.82] and 90\% had calculus. The correlation between DMFS and the calculus index was 0.064. A total of 36 children were caries-free and 56 had calculus including teeth other than those in the lower anterior region (calculus score {$\geq$}3). A total of 23 caries-free children with a high calculus score ({$\geq$}3) were compared with 22 children with the highest DMFS [mean 11.19 (SD 5.58)] and a calculus score {$<$} 3. No significant difference was obtained for saliva and plaque pH. The salivary levels of mutans Streptococci and Lactobacilli were low. Significantly more children in the caries group had high levels of glycolytic Prevotella nigrescens and Filifactor alocis in plaque compared with the calculus group. Calculus cases had a significantly higher total viable count in saliva. Conclusions. There was no inverse correlation between the presence of caries and calculus at a population level and a high calculus score only marginally reduced the individual likelihood of having caries. Several glycolytic bacteria were related to caries, while no specific bacteria could be related to calculus formation. Calculus seemed to be more closely related to poor oral hygiene.},

Bioapatite crystallinity is used to diagnose pathologies in modern calcified tissues as well as to assess the preservation state of fossil bones. To date, infrared spectroscopy is one of the most applied techniques for bone characterisation and the derived infrared splitting factor (IRSF) has been widely used to practically assess bioapatite crystallinity. Here we thoroughly discuss and revise the use of the IRSF parameter and its meaning as a crystallinity indicator, based on extensive measurements of fresh and fossil bones, virtually covering the known range of crystallinity degree of bioapatite. A novel way to calculate and use the infrared peak width as a suitable measurement of true apatite crystallinity is proposed, and validated by combined measurement of the same samples through X-ray diffraction. The non-linear correlation between the infrared peak width and the derived ISRF is explained. As shown, the infrared peak width at 604\,cm-1 can be effectively used to assess both the average crystallite size and structural carbonate content of bioapatite, thus establishing a universal calibration curve of practical use.},

By measuring the decrease in Ca2+ concentration (by means of ion-selective electrodes), we determined both spontaneous precipitation and seeded crystal growth from solutions that contained 1 mmol/L calcium, 7.5 mmol/L phosphate, 50 mmol/L Hepes pH 7.2, and various amounts of silicic acid. Polymerized silicic acid, but not its monomer, was found both to cause a 60\% reduction in the lag period that precedes spontaneous precipitation and to enhance the growth rate of seeded hydroxyapatite crystals. Silica suspensions showed effects similar to those of polysilicic acid. In all cases, the precipitated material was found to be hydroxyapatite. Whereas seeded brushite crystals grew slowly without silicic acid, hydroxyapatite was the only mineral detected after crystal growth in the presence of silicic acid. Apparently, polysilicic acid acted as a substrate for hydroxyapatite nucleation, inducing secondary nuclei on both hydroxyapatite and brushite crystals. The finding that polysilicic acid could overcome part of the inhibitory effect of a phosphoprotein on calcium phosphate precipitation gave additional support for the idea that polysilicic acid and silica may promote the formation of dental calculus.},

Bacteriocins are a heterogeneous group of particles with different morphological and biochemical entities. They range from a simple protein to a high molecular weight complex: the active moiety of each molecule in all cases seems to be protein in nature. The genetic determinants of most of the bacteriocins are located on the plasmids, apart from few which are chromosomally encoded. These bactericidal particles are species specific. They exert their lethal activity through adsorption to specific receptors located on the external surface of sensitive bacteria, followed by metabolic, biological and morphological changes resulting in the killing of such bacteria. This review summarises the classification, biochemical nature, morphology and mode of action of bacteriocins as well as their genetic determinants and the microbiological relevance of these bactericidal agents.},

Salivary flow rate peaked at 5.1 mL/min in the first min but fell to about 1.25 mL/ min by the end of the 20 min of gum-chewing. In contrast, flow rate when subjects sucked sour lemon drops averaged about 5.3 mL/min throughout the 20-minute period. The mean salivary sucrose concentration during gum-chewing peaked in the second min at 384 mmol/L (13.1\%) but had fallen to 14 mmol/L by the 15-20-minute time interval. The sucrose concentrations on the palatal surfaces of the upper incisors and the facial and lingual surfaces of the lower molars were not significantly different from that in EWS but were much lower on the facial surfaces of the upper incisors and molars, and on the lingual surfaces of the lower incisors. When flow was unstimulated, SFV was 0.8-1.0 mm/min on the facial surfaces of the upper incisors and lower molars but about 5-8 mm/min on the facial surfaces of the upper molars and on the lingual surfaces of the lower incisors and molars. During chewing-gum use, the SFV increased only to 4 and 10 mm/min on the facial surfaces of the upper incisors and lower molars, respectively, but on the facial surfaces of the upper molars and on the lingual aspects of the lower incisors and molars, it became equivalent to that in a well-stirred solution. This study showed that even during gum-chewing, which would be expected to facilitate the mixing of the different salivary secretions, the saliva provided a series of distinctly different fluid environments, some with cariogenic and others with calculogenic potential, for plaque in different regions of the mouth.},

A new ordinal method for scoring dental wear stages on the deciduous molar teeth was devised. It was postulated that if a discernible relationship between dental wear stage and burial location could be seen then this could reflect a difference in diet between those receiving higher or lower status burial. The dental wear stages recorded were statistically similar for the dentitions of subadults from different cemeteries, as well as from different burial locations, indicating a comparable diet for the children studied.

  abstract = {Summary This study investigated the prevalence of dental wear in 12-year-old adolescents using a modification of the tooth wear index (TWI). The modifications were proposed in order to fit with the World Health Organization standard, thus allowing application of the index in broad epidemiological surveys. An epidemiological cross-sectional survey was performed by trained, calibrated examiners, using a modified version of the TWI. Urban elementary schools were chosen because they provide a fair representation of the city's population in terms of socio-economic status. The sample included 295 adolescents, selected randomly and systematically. Dental wear was assessed by calibrated examiners (kappa{$>$}0.85), using a modified version of the TWI. This modified version includes a code for teeth restored due to wear, and another code for teeth that cannot be assessed. In addition, it does not differentiate the depth of dentine involvement. Proportions and confidence intervals were used to describe the prevalence of dental wear. Mann-Whitney test was used to detect differences in the degree of dental wear between males and females. The level of statistical significance was set at 5\%. In total, 24,780 dental surfaces were evaluated. Among these surfaces, 73.10\% did not present dental wear, 24.10\% had incipient lesions, 2.46\% had moderate lesions and 0.34\% had been restored. No severe lesions were detected. Tooth wear was mainly seen on the occlusal/incisal surfaces (26.55\%), involving enamel or enamel-dentine, but not the secondary dentine or pulp. The prevalence of dental wear was 26.90\%. Considering the different teeth, wear was present in 53.22\% of incisors, 50.51\% of canines, 10.17\% of premolars and 10.85\% of molars. The prevalence of the different degrees of dental wear was similar in males and females (P{$>$}0.05). The modified TWI seems to be an effective tool for use in broad epidemiological surveys, due to easier calibration and high reproducibility rates.},

This research examines if plant material can accidently enter the mouth while being processed for a meal, with a focus on starch granules. Grinding experiments were performed on three types of cereal grains (wheat, oat and millet). We compare the presence of intact and altered starch granules in mouthwash samples (in place of dental calculus samples) from individuals involved in grinding and also from samples in the environment surrounding the grinding activity. This experiment is a proof of concept aimed to expand experimental research in the field of dental calculus analysis and to encourage the exploration of pathways beyond direct and deliberate consumption.},

All 40 deciduous tooth diameters (20 mesiolingual and 20 faciolingual) were significantly different between the sexes, as were the permanent tooth diameters.

Combinations of deciduous and permanent measurements were used to classify 83 to 85\% of the holdout samples correctly. When compared with published data on other sample populations, the Burlington group is the most dimorphic for deciduous teeth and is within the range of permanent tooth dimorphisms of other populations.

Because tradeoffs between growth and reproduction can result in earlier ages at menarche and lower limb length, we assess menarcheal age between 1120 and 1540 CE to better understand the health of medieval adolescent females before and after the plague. Materials and Methods Our sample comprises 74 adolescent females from St. Mary Spital, London (1120-1540 CE) within the age range during which menarche occurs (10-25 years). They were assessed as being pre- or post-menarcheal and divided into three groups: Early Pre-Black Death (n = 13), Late Pre-Black Death (n = 38), and Post-Black Death (n = 23). Changes in the ages of pre- and post-menarcheal females were assessed using Mann-Whitney tests. Results The average age of post-menarcheal females increased from the Early- to Late Pre-Black Death periods and declined after the Black Death. Conclusions Short stature can reflect unfavorable growth environments, while younger menarcheal age indicates improved living conditions. The paradoxical pattern of female, but not male, stature reduction after the Black Death might reflect the association of early menarche with lower limb length and signal that adolescent females experienced improved health conditions after the epidemic. Our focus on pre- and post-menarche within a limited age span provides a novel approach for inferring average ages of menarche over time.

This study addresses whether such female advantages existed to any appreciable degree in medieval Europe. The analyses presented here examine whether men and women with osteological stress markers faced the same risks of death in medieval London. The sample used for this study comes from the East Smithfield Black Death cemetery in London. The benefit of using this cemetery is that most, if not all, individuals interred in East Smithfield died from the same cause within a very short period of time. This allows for the analysis of the differences between men and women in the risks of mortality associated with osteological stress markers without the potential confounding effects of different causes of death. A sample of 299 adults (173 males, 126 females) from the East Smithfield cemetery was analyzed. The results indicate that the excess mortality associated with several osteological stress markers was higher for men than for women. This suggests that in this medieval population, previous physiological stress increased the risk of death for men during the Black Death to a greater extent than was true for women. Alternatively, the results might indicate that the Black Death discriminated less strongly between women with and without pre-existing health conditions than was true for men. These results are examined in light of previous analyses of East Smithfield and what is known about diet and sexually mediated access to resources in medieval England.

These trends indicate that there were declines in general levels of health before the Black Death and improvements thereof afterwards. This study expands on previous research by examining whether changes in survivorship were consistent between the sexes, and how patterns of developmental stress markers changed before and after the Black Death. Materials and Methods This study uses samples from London cemeteries dated to one of three periods: Early Pre-Black Death (1000\textendash 1200 AD, n = 255), Late Pre-Black Death (1200\textendash 1250 AD, n = 247), or Post-Black Death (1350\textendash 1540 AD n = 329). Temporal trends in survivorship are assessed via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and trends in tibial length (as a proxy for stature) and linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH) are assessed using t-tests and Chi-square tests, respectively. Results Survivorship for both sexes decreased before the Black Death and increased afterwards. For males, LEH frequencies increased and stature decreased before the epidemic, and LEH declined and stature increased after the Black Death. For females, the only significant change with respect to developmental stress markers was a decrease in stature after the Black Death. Conclusions These results might reflect variation between the sexes in sensitivity to stressors, the effects of nutrition on pubertal timing, disproportionate access to dietary resources for males in the aftermath of the Black Death, the disproportionate deaths of frail individuals during the epidemic, or some combination of these factors.},

  abstract = {Diffusion through plaque was measured with an apparatus consisting of 3 identical diffusion cells contained in an aluminium alloy block thermostatically controlled at 35 \textdegree C. In two of the cells, measurements were made of diffusion through a composite membrane consisting of 18 h dental plaque contained between bacteriological grade filters and support screens. In the third cell, diffusion occurred through a reference membrane from which the bulk of the plaque was absent. Subtraction of the diffusion resistance of this reference membrane allowed calculation of apparent tracer diffusion coefficients in the bulk of the plaque alone. Diffusion of 14C-labelled sugars and carboxylic acids was compared with that of tritiated water using dual-channel liquid scintillation counting. The diffusion coefficient of tritiated water in the plaque samples varied from 0.81 to 1.02 \texttimes{} 10-9 m2s-1 depending on the wet wt used, with coefficients of variation of \textasciitilde{} 15 per cent. This is between 14 and 13 of the value in aqueous solution. Diffusion coefficients relative to that of tritiated water in plaque ranged from 0.154 {$\pm$} 0.014 for sucrose to 0.363 {$\pm$} 0.029 for acetate. Permselectivity was low, and diffusion coefficients of I he test molecules were all between 14 and 15 of their values in free aqueous solution.},

  abstract = {Urea diffusing from saliva into dental plaque is converted to ammonia and carbon dioxide by bacterial ureases. The influence of normal salivary urea levels on the pH of fasted plaque and on the depth and duration of a Stephan curve is uncertain. A numerical model which simulates a cariogenic challenge (a 10\% sucrose rinse alone or one followed by use of chewing-gum with or without sugar) was modified to include salivary urea levels from 0 to 30 mmol/l. It incorporated: site-dependent exchange between bulk saliva and plaque surfaces via a salivary film; sugar and urea diffusion into plaque; pH-dependent rates of acid formation and urea breakdown; diffusion and dissociation of end-products and other buffers (acetate, lactate, phosphate, ammonia and carbonate); diffusion of protons and other ions; equilibration with fixed and mobile buffers; and chargecoupling between ionic flows. The Km (2.12 mmol/l) and Vmax (0.11 \textmu mol urea/ min/mg dry weight) values for urease activity and the pH dependence of Vmax were taken from the literature. From the results, it is predicted that urea concentrations normally present in saliva (3\textendash 5 mmol/l) will increase the pH at the base of a 0.5-mm-thick fasted plaque by up to 1 pH unit, and raise the pH minimum after a sucrose rinse or sugar-containing chewing-gum by at least half a pH unit. The results suggest that plaque cariogenicity may be inversely related to salivary urea concentrations, not only when the latter are elevated because of disease, but even when they are in the normal range.},

  abstract = {This review of human tooth wear describes the fundamental mechanisms underlying this process. Using the tribological approach they can be systematised and this in turn aids our understanding of them. In past populations wear was ubiquitous, intense, abrasive and physiological as it was related to their food and their technologies. In these populations, it affected the proximal surfaces, and the occlusal surfaces which modified the occlusal plane profoundly. To categorise this wear many different classification systems are used, from which we can determine diet, cultural changes and the age at death of individuals. They also illustrate the evolution of certain functional dental and skeletal compensations in the masticatory apparatus such as continuous dental eruption, mesial drift of the arches and incisor lingual tipping which can then be monitored. These physiological adaptations related mainly to function and ontogenesis can also be found in present-day populations where wear is moderate, although they are much less obtrusive. Apart from certain pathological cases associated with a specific parafunction, iatrogenic tooth brushing or an eating disorder and encouraged by an acid environment, they are the result of a physiological process that should not be halted. To ensure this, it is essential to prevent lesions related to tooth wear, to detect them early and establish a reliable diagnosis. Types of tooth wear that had remained unchanged since the origin of humanity have undergone profound changes in a very short space of time. Today's tribochemical pathological model has replaced the abrasive physiological model of the past.},

  abstract = {Abstract A large sample (n = 370) of Central California prehistoric skeletal remains was analyzed for sexual dimorphism of long bones using nine femoral and nine humeral dimensions. Sex of all individuals was assessed using traits of the os pubis. Discriminant analysis was done separately for the robust Early Horizon sample and the Middle/Late Horizon sample. Use of multiple variables did not produce appreciably better results over the use of several of the best variables, analyzed singly. Attention is focused on measurements of maximum diameter femoral head, femoral bicondylar width, and diameter of the humeral head (transverse or vertical). These variables produce excellent separation of the sexes with about 90\% accuracy for the Middle/Late Horizon sample. They have been overlooked in the recent literature in which the relative values of length versus midshaft dimensions are debated. The measurements found to be superior in this study are taken at the ends of the bones where durability of these regions is indicated by large sample sizes found in this study. We suggest workers redirect their focus from the midshaft to the ends of the long bones. The discriminant analyses presented here have greater accuracy than most claims for either long bone or cranial sex determination. These standards, based on two samples with differing robusticity, may have applicability for workers in other areas who lack large skeletal samples.}

Secondary experiments (using subsets of the panel of subjects) were undertaken in an attempt to elucidate some of the reasons for the observed plaque pH changes. Oral carbohydrate retention was measured at a single time period after food use as total anthrone-positive carbohydrate material, and as specific acidogenic sugars by gas-liquid chromatography after gel-exclusion chromatography. The concentrations of acid anions in the plaque fluid after food consumption were measured by isotachophoresis eight min after food use. According to the plaque pH response, apple-flavored fruit drink and chocolate were the most acidogenic foods and skimmed milk powder the least acidogenic.

Data Saliva influences oral health both through its non-specific physico-chemical properties, as well as through more specific effects. The proline-rich proteins, statherin and the histatins are salivary proteins that influence calcium phosphate chemistry, initial plaque formation and candida infection. Increases or decreases in mastication may affect saliva output. Our cross-sectional studies of saliva in a large population-based study cohort (N=1130) indicate that there is an age-related decline in saliva output for unstimulated whole, stimulated parotid, unstimulated submandibular/sublingual and stimulated submandibular/sublingual saliva, as well as some compositional alterations in anti-microbial and other proteins. Some of these alterations also appear to be specific for certain age-related medical conditions, such as diabetes mellitus. Conclusions These studies and data presented confirm the importance of saliva in maintaining a healthy oral environment; the practitioner is encouraged to consider saliva output and medical conditions that may compromise it as part of routine dental treatment planning.},

The models for sex estimation were operationalized through an online application and decision support system, CADOES. Different classification algorithms generated high accuracy models, ranging from 85\% to 92\%, with only three variables; and from 85.33\% to 97.33\%, with all 38 variables. CADOES conveys a probabilistic prediction of skeletal sex, as well as a suite of attributes with educational applicability in the fields of human skeletal anatomy and statistics.

The aim of this study was to examine the influence of starch and sucrose, alone or in combinations, on formation, polysaccharide composition, gene expression, and acidogenicity of Streptococcus mutans biofilms. Methods: S. mutans UA159 biofilms were formed on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sHA) discs in batch culture for 5 days in the presence of 1\% (weight/volume) starch, 1\% sucrose, 1\% starch plus 1\% sucrose, 1\% starch plus 0.5\% fructose plus 0.5\% glucose, or 1\% sucrose plus 1\% glucose. Results: Amylase activity from sHA disks was detected up to 48 h, thereby increasing the availability of reducing sugars and acidogenicity in the early stages of biofilm development. S. mutans grown in the presence of sucrose alone or in combinations formed well-defined and tightly adherent biofilms comprised of mostly water-insoluble polysaccharides (INS); in contrast, the presence of starch or starch + glucose + fructose resulted in little biofilm formation with minimal amounts of INS. However, the combination of starch + sucrose produced biofilms with more biomass and acidogenicity, and a higher content of INS than those grown in sucrose or sucrose + glucose (P {$<$} 0.05). The INS extracted from biofilms formed in the presence of starch + sucrose displayed a higher percentage of 3-linked branching (3,4-, 3,6-, and 3,4,6-linked glucose) compared to those from biofilms grown in sucrose or sucrose + glucose. Furthermore, biofilms grown in starch + sucrose expressed significantly higher levels of gtfB messenger RNA than sucrose-grown or sucrose + glucose-grown biofilms (P {$<$} 0.05). Conclusion: The combination of starch and sucrose has profound effects not only on the composition and structure of the polysaccharide matrix but also on gene expression of S. mutans within biofilms, which may enhance the cariogenic potential of dental biofilms.},

Calculus was extracted from 114 teeth representing 104 unique individuals from a late 16th to early 18th century skeletal series on Rapa Nui (Easter Island) to address questions of human\textendash environment interactions and possible dietary preference. Scanning electron microscopy was used in lieu of optical microscopy for its superior depth of field and resolution of surface detail. The calculus microfossil recovery produced 16,377 total biogenic silica microfossils: 4733 phytoliths and 11,644 diatoms. The majority of phytoliths correspond with the Arecaceae or palm family (n = 4,456) and the minority corresponds to the Poaceae or grass family (n = 277). Because of the relatively large sample size, we were able to test hypotheses related to age cohort, sex, dental element and geographic region. Results indicate no significant difference in phytolith or diatom recovery based on age cohort or sex. The high frequency and proportion of Arecaceae phytoliths found in calculus extracted from the anterior dentition suggests consumption of soft or cooked foods containing palm phytoliths and the high frequency of diatoms recovered from the southern part of the island argue for different sources of drinking water.

Tests show that the use of hydrochloric acid results in a concentration of some taxa like Ascaris sp. or Trichuris sp. and an appreciable decrease in vegetal and mineral remains. However, tests also show that acid use systematically decreases parasite species identified, as compared to the standard RHM protocol. Base use yielded even more negative results with systematically lower biodiversity than with the standard protocol, probably due to chemical processes on chitin contained in the eggshell. These results suggest acids and sodium hydroxide should be used as little as possible during extraction due to the damages they cause to the eggs of some parasite species. The counting method was an efficient technique with which to demonstrate our results and could be used in future paleoparasitology studies.},

  abstract = {The consumption of plant-derived hallucinogenic substances through smoking and snuffing is a long-standing tradition in the south-central Andes. Chemical and archaeobotanical evidence point to the consumption of nicotine and tryptamine alkaloids in Northwestern Argentina and of tryptamine alkaloids in San Pedro de Atacama (SPA), in prehispanic times. In this paper, results are reported of gas chromatography\textendash mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses aimed at identifying nicotine and tryptamine alkaloids in the hair of mummies from different cultural periods of SPA. Fifty-six samples were examined. While tryptamines were not found in any of the samples, nicotine was found in 35 samples, assigned to the Late Formative (1 of 1 sample from this period), Late Formative or Middle (1 of 2 samples from either of these periods), Middle (4 of 6 samples from this period) and Late Intermediate periods (8 of 12 samples from this period), or without assignment to period due to lack of contextual information (21 of 35 samples unassigned to a period). These results show a continuous consumption of nicotine from the Late Formative to the Late Intermediate periods of SPA (ca. 100 B.C.\textendash 1450 A.D.). No associations were found between presence of nicotine in the hair of mummies and presence of snuffing trays or of other snuffing paraphernalia in the corresponding tomb; furthermore, neither the diversity of the funerary context, measured in terms of the number of types of objects, nor the presence of gemstone necklaces differed between tombs with mummies with or without nicotine in their hair. Overall, these results suggest that consumption of nicotine was performed by members of the society at large, irrespective of their social and wealth status.},

However, much of what is known about the behavior of oral species to date derives from pure culture approaches and the studies combining several cultivated species, which likely does not fully reflect their function in complex microbial communities. It has been shown in studies with a limited number of cultivated species that early oral biofilm development occurs in a successional manner and that continuous low pH can lead to an enrichment of aciduric species. Observations that in vitro grown plaque biofilm microcosms can maintain similar pH profiles in response to carbohydrate addition as plaque in vivo suggests a complex microbial community can be established in the laboratory. In light of this, our primary goal was to develop a robust in vitro biofilm-model system from a pooled saliva inoculum in order to study the stability, reproducibility, and development of the oral microbiome, and its dynamic response to environmental changes from the community to the molecular level.},

  abstract = {Background: Dental plaque is composed of hundreds of bacterial taxonomic units and represents one of the most diverse and stable microbial ecosystems associated with the human body. Taxonomic composition and functional capacity of mature plaque is gradually shaped during several stages of community assembly via processes such as co-aggregation, competition for space and resources, and by bacterially produced reactive agents. Knowledge on the dynamics of assembly within complex communities is very limited and derives mainly from studies composed of a limited number of bacterial species. To fill current knowledge gaps, we applied parallel metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses during assembly and maturation of an in vitro oral biofilm. This model system has previously demonstrated remarkable reproducibility in taxonomic composition across replicate samples during maturation. Results: Time course analysis of the biofilm maturation was performed by parallel sampling every 2\textendash 3 h for 24 h for both DNA and RNA. Metagenomic analyses revealed that community taxonomy changed most dramatically between three and six hours of growth when pH dropped from 6.5 to 5.5. By applying comparative metatranscriptome analysis we could identify major shifts in overall community activities between six and nine hours of growth when pH dropped below 5.5, as 29,015 genes were significantly up- or down- expressed. Several of the differentially expressed genes showed unique activities for individual bacterial genomes and were associated with pyruvate and lactate metabolism, two-component signaling pathways, production of antibacterial molecules, iron sequestration, pH neutralization, protein hydrolysis, and surface attachment. Our analysis also revealed several mechanisms responsible for the niche expansion of the cariogenic pathogen Lactobacillus fermentum. Conclusion: It is highly regarded that acidic conditions in dental plaque cause a net loss of enamel from teeth. Here, as pH drops below 5.5 pH to 4.7, we observe blooms of cariogenic lactobacilli, and a transition point of many bacterial gene expression activities within the community. To our knowledge, this represents the first study of the assembly and maturation of a complex oral bacterial biofilm community that addresses gene level functional responses over time.},

We present Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS) results of analyses of ten archaeological calculus samples from eight individuals from Central California. Two samples tested positive for the presence of nicotine, including one from an individual buried with a pipe. UPLC-MS analyses of dental calculus could provide an alternative means to trace the spread and consumption of tobacco and other plants with distinctive alkaloid products in ancient societies. As shown here for the first time in ancient samples, the ability to detect nicotine alkaloids in calculus has enormous potential to help us better understand the consumption of intoxicant plants by ancient humans on the individual level, for example by giving us the ability to test assumptions about the age, sex, and status of individual tobacco users in the past.},

The aim of the present 3-year longitudinal study was to investigate the association between a broad collection of biological and behavioural factors and the incidence and progression of erosive tooth wear among adolescents. The study sample consisted of 656 attendees of a dental clinic with at baseline a mean age of 11.9 years (SD = 0.9). The criteria for the assessment of erosive wear were a modification of the erosion criteria developed by Lussi [Eur J Oral Sci 1996;104:191\textendash 198]. Information on biological and behavioural factors was gathered by clinical examinations (at baseline, after 1.5 and 3 years) and by self-reported questionnaires (completed semi-annually). Of the erosion-free children at baseline, 24.2\% developed erosive wear. In children with erosion at baseline, 68.3\% showed progression. Multivariate analyses showed significant associations between the incidence of erosive tooth wear and alcoholic mixed drinks (odds ratio, OR = 1.82), sour vegetables (OR = 1.16) and tooth grinding (OR = 4.03). The intake of yoghurt products was significantly negatively associated with the incidence of erosive wear (OR = 0.79). The interaction of acidic products and tooth grinding showed a significant extra risk (OR = 1.2). The intake of vitamins was positively associated with progression (OR = 2.03). Erosive wear was less likely to progress in subjects who consumed milk and yoghurt products (OR = 0.89 and 0.76, respectively). The present study showed that the aetiology of erosive tooth wear is complex. Possible aetiological factors include more than acidic drinks, and factors such as tooth grinding play a large role.}

First permanent molars and second primary molars were scored with respect to DMH or MIH. The prevalence of DMH and MIH was 9.0\% and 8.7\% at child level, and 4.0\% and 5.4\% at tooth level. The Odds Ratio for MIH based on DMH was 4.4 (95\% CI, 3.1-6.4).

However, these tooth classes are lost differentially in postmortem stages due to their anatomical structures. This differential postmortem tooth loss distorts proportions between the anterior and posterior tooth classes. The disproportionality can affect the calculation of total caries prevalence. In this paper, we propose a new calibration procedure which removes this disproportionality and call it the proportional correction factor. For this procedure, the caries rates of anterior and posterior teeth are corrected by multiplying the anterior teeth by three-eighths and the posterior teeth by five-eighths. These fractions are derived from the human dental formula which contains three anterior and five posterior teeth by side. The correction factor is more effective if the proportion of anterior to the posterior teeth is extremely distorted. When this procedure is used with the caries correction factor, it provides a useful way to approach to an almost true caries prevalence.

Method: This was a prospective cross-sectional study involving 642 (270 males, 372 females) healthy Black South African participants aged 5\textendash 20 years. The height and BMI were converted to z-scores using WHO z-score for age tables.

Materials and methods This community-based cross-sectional study involved 639 Black Southern African children between 5 and 20\,years of age. Probit analysis was used to derive the mean age at emergence of the permanent teeth. Sex and cross-population comparisons were undertaken to determine similarities and differences in emergence timing and sequence. Results Females emerged all teeth earlier except for M3s (p {$<$}\,.05). Black Southern Africans have earlier mean ages of emergence compared to population samples from the USA, Europe, Australia, and Asia. Sexual dimorphism was detected in the mandibular I1/M1 emergence sequence (females, M1I1; males, I1M1). The sequence in males is similar in both jaws to males from other sub-Saharan African, USA, and European samples. Females show a similar sequence pattern in the maxilla with other sub-Saharan African, and also Australian and US females of European ancestry. There is a high frequency of polymorphism in the P1P2C1 emergence sequence, with significantly more P2P1C1 maxillary sequences seen among males. Polymorphic variation was common for the I1M1 sequence in both males and females. Discussion Mean age of tooth emergence among Black Southern African children is similar to children from most other sub-Saharan African populations. No temporal change was seen in the mean age of emergence. Earlier permanent tooth emergence in Black Southern Africans is part of a general sub-Saharan pattern that is distinct from European and Asian populations.}

  abstract = {The oral cavity is a heterogeneous environment, varying in factors such as pH, oxygen levels, and salivary flow. These factors affect the microbial community composition and distribution of species in dental plaque, but it is not known how well these patterns are reflected in archaeological dental calculus. In most archaeological studies, a single sample of dental calculus is studied per individual and is assumed to represent the entire oral cavity. However, it is not known if this sampling strategy introduces biases into studies of the ancient oral microbiome. Here, we present the results of a shotgun metagenomic study of a dense sampling of dental calculus from four Chalcolithic individuals from the southeast Iberian peninsula (ca. 4500-5000 BP). Inter-individual differences in microbial composition are found to be much larger than intra-individual differences, indicating that a single sample can indeed represent an individual in most cases. However, there are minor spatial patterns in species distribution within the oral cavity that should be taken into account when designing a study or interpreting results. Finally, we show that plant DNA identified in the samples may be of environmental origin, showing the importance of including environmental controls or several lines of biomolecular evidence.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.}

  abstract = {The oral cavity is a heterogeneous environment, varying in factors such as pH, oxygen levels, and salivary flow. These factors affect the microbial community composition and distribution of species in dental plaque, but it is not known how well these patterns are reflected in archaeological dental calculus. In most archaeological studies, a single sample of dental calculus is studied per individual and is assumed to represent the entire oral cavity. However, it is not known if this sampling strategy introduces biases into studies of the ancient oral microbiome. Here, we present the results of a shotgun metagenomic study of a dense sampling of dental calculus from four Chalcolithic individuals from the southeast Iberian peninsula (ca. 4500\textendash 5000 BP). Interindividual differences in microbial composition are found to be much larger than intraindividual differences, indicating that a single sample can indeed represent an individual in most cases. However, there are minor spatial patterns in species distribution within the oral cavity that should be taken into account when designing a study or interpreting results. Finally, we show that plant DNA identified in the samples is likely of postmortem origin, demonstrating the importance of including environmental controls or additional lines of biomolecular evidence in dietary interpretations.}

  abstract = {Archaeological materials are a finite resource, and efforts should be made to minimize destructive analyses. This can be achieved by using protocols combining extraction of several types of biomolecules or microparticles, which decreases the material needed for analyses while maximizing the information yield. Archaeological dental calculus is a source of several different types of biomolecules, as well as microfossils, and can tell us about the human host, microbiome, diet, and even occupational activities. Here, we present a unified protocol allowing for simultaneous extraction of DNA and proteins from a single sample of archaeological dental calculus. We evaluate the protocol on dental calculus from six individuals from a range of time periods and estimated preservation states, and compare it against previously published DNA-only and protein-only protocols. We find that most aspects of downstream analyses are unaltered by the unified protocol, although minor shifts in the recovered proteome can be detected, such as a slight loss of hydrophilic proteins. Total protein recovery depends on both the amount of starting material and choice of extraction protocol, whereas total DNA recovery is significantly reduced using the unified protocol (mean 43\%). Nevertheless, total DNA recovery from dental calculus is generally very high, and we found no differences in DNA fragment characteristics or taxonomic profile between the protocols. In conclusion, the unified protocol allows for simultaneous extraction of two complementary lines of biomolecular evidence from archaeological dental calculus without compromising downstream results, thereby minimizing the need for destructive analysis of this finite resource.},

  abstract = {Abstract Objectives Though applied in bioarchaeology, dental wear is an underexplored age indicator in the biological anthropology of contemporary populations, although research has been conducted on dental attrition in forensic contexts (Kim et al., , Journal of Forensic Sciences, 45, 303; Prince et al., , Journal of Forensic Sciences, 53, 588; Yun et al., , Journal of Forensic Sciences, 52, 678). The purpose of this study is to apply and adapt existing techniques for age estimation based on dental wear to a modern American population, with the aim of producing accurate age range estimates for individuals from an industrialized context. Materials and methods Methodologies following Yun and Prince were applied to a random sample from the University of New Mexico (n\,=\,583) and Universidade de Coimbra (n\,=\,50) cast and skeletal collections. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and linear regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between tooth wear scores and age. Results Application of both Yun et al. () and Prince et al. () methodologies resulted in inaccurate age estimates. Recalibrated sectioning points correctly classified individuals as over or under 50 years for 88\% of the sample. Linear regression demonstrated 60\% of age estimates fell within {$\pm$}10 years of the actual age, and accuracy improved for individuals under 45 years, with 74\% of predictions within {$\pm$}10 years. Discussion This study demonstrates age estimation from dental wear is possible for modern populations, with comparable age intervals to other established methods. It provides a quantifiable method of seriation into ``older'' and ``younger'' adult categories, and provides more reliable age interval estimates than cranial sutures in instances where only the skull is available.}

  abstract = {Background The gut microbiome has become a hot topic in recent years with increasing reports on the positive role of a well-balanced gut microbiota composition for one's health and well-being. A number of dietary factors can modulate gut composition, although few publications have focused on common daily beverages impact on the gut microbiome. Coffee is a worldwide beverage consumed mostly as black coffee that is originally derived from green coffee beans post roasting. To enhance the taste and aroma, green coffee is typically roasted and to further affect its chemical composition and rationalize for the different health outcomes. Roasted seeds contain a high caffeine levels versus phenolic acids i.e., chlorogenic acid enrichment in green coffee suggestive that they interact differently with gut microbiota and to affect its metabolism. Scope and approach The present review provides a mechanistic insight on the effects of black and green coffee chemicals on the gut microbiome. We present herein the first comprehensive review of how coffee natural bioactive such as caffeine and chlorogenic acid and its process derived chemicals i.e., melanoidins can specifically influence gut homeostasis, and likewise via gut microbiota-mediated coffee chemicals metabolism. Key findings and conclusions The role of gut microbiota in affecting coffee chemicals and the potential of mining metagenomics data to uncover gut microbiome community and carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZyme) profile associated with coffee consumption are presented for the first time. Moreover, our metagenomics analysis in silico showed a decrease in abundance in either Desulfofarcimen or Mycoplasma genera, confirmed the basic coffee-gut microbial enzymes repertoire found in the literature and highlights for the first time the coffee CAZyme biomarkers encoded by the human gut microbiome.},

Here, we review recent studies of animal behavior toward the dying, diseased, or disabled which may be of interest to paleopathologists and bioarchaeologists studying compassionate behavior in humans and their extinct ancestors. `Compassionate' behavior toward the enfeebled and dying has now been reported in several non-primate mammals (e.g., wild African elephants and river otters) and nonhuman primates (primarily captive chimpanzees). In addition, a number of recent reports have documented wide variation in nonhuman primates' reactions to recently deceased group mates (or offspring) both across species, as well as across individuals belonging to the same social group. We suggest there is considerable potential for collaboration among paleopathologists and primatologists in examining the causes of illness and disability in animals and its impact on their lives.},

To assess the repeatability of maximal bite force estimates as obtained by submaximal electromyographic-force relationships performed simultaneously and symmetrically in both sides of the mouth. The protocol could be used in a clinical context to obtain indicative values for the occlusal loads to be resisted by the prosthetic reconstructions. Methods. Ten young healthy subjects performed; (1) a maximum voluntary clench (MVC) directly on their occlusal surfaces; (2) four simultaneous recording of submaximal bite forces (98, 196, 304 and 392 N on two transducers positioned on the left and right first mandibular molars) and surface EMG potentials of the masseter and temporalis anterior muscles. The actual force peak value was recorded. For each subject, a linear regression was run between the simultaneous bite force and EMG submaximal values recorded in the four tests. Using the EMG potentials obtained during the MVC tests, the best fitting line was used to estimate a maximum bite force. Two independent recordings were made by each subject (2 week interval) and analyzed by correlation analysis, paired Student's t-test, and Dahlberg statistic. Results. Significant linear relationships were found between bite force and EMG potientials (p{$<$}0.01). The two series of indirect estimates of maximal bite force were correlated (r=0.626), without systematic differences (Student's t, p{$>$}0.05). Dahlberg statistic was 115.37 N (approximately 36\% of the total variance of the group). Conclusions. Simultaneously recorded submaximal bite forces and surface EMG potentials of mandibular elevator muscles had a linear relationship. The estimates of maximum bite force were repeatable on a short-term basis (2 weeks). The method limited the disadvantages of bite force recordings, and it could be used to obtain indicative values for the occlusal loads to be resisted by the prosthetic reconstructions.},

In the second sample, presence of copper could confirm that bronze jewelery could lie near the buried body. The elemental composition of the third sample with the presence of lead and copper confirms the origin of individual to Napoleonic Wars because the damage to his teeth could be explained by the systematic utilization of the teeth for the opening of paper cartridges (a charge with a dose of gunpowder and a bullet), which were used during the 18th and the 19th century AD.

Although there are cultural differences in the archaeological record between regions, it is still debatable how these differences may relate to different population histories. Here, we contribute to this discussion by exploring dental morphological affinities between several regional series. Materials and Methods Dental morphology of 385 individuals from 14 archaeological sites was analyzed using the Arizona State University Dental Anthropology System. Fifteen traits were used to explore morphological affinities among series through Euclidean distance, Mean Measure of Divergence, and Principal Component Analysis. Mantel matrix correlation and partial correlation tests were used to examine the association between biological, geographic, and chronological distances. Results Morphological affinities show that ceramic and nonceramic South Coast groups cluster and differ from most Southeast series. In contrast, Southeast coastal and riverine groups display high morphological variance, showing less biological coherence among them. These biological distances between regions are partially explained by geography, but not by chronology. Conclusions The results support that these coastal populations were low-mobility groups. Although interactions between individuals of different regions likely existed, gene flow occurred mostly among individuals from local or adjacent areas. The introduction of ceramic in the South Coast is not associated with changes in dental morphology patterns, suggesting its adoption is not exclusively associated with the arrival of different biological groups. Southeast coastal and riverine groups show high phenotypic diversity, suggesting a different history of human occupation and cultural development than observed in the South Coast.},

The analysis of salivary metabolites is a growing area of investigation with potential for basic and clinical applications. Analyses of children's saliva in different dentitions and with or without caries could potentially reveal a specific profile related to oral disease risk. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is well suited for mixture analysis followed by Principal Component Analysis combined with Linear Regression (PCA-LR) statistics and was used to identify differences in the salivary metabolites. The classificatory analysis was performed using PCA-LR based on 1,000 cross-validation bootstrap runs from both classifiers in order to increase the data information from a small sample size. The PCA-LR presented a statistically good classificatory performance for children with and without caries with an accuracy of 90.11~\% (P~{$<~$}0.001), 89.61~\% sensitivity (P~{$<~$}0.001), and 90.82~\% specificity (P~{$<~$}0.001). Children with caries lesions presented higher levels of several metabolites, including lactate, fatty acid, acetate and n-butyrate. Saliva from subjects with different dentition stages was also analyzed. Although the salivary samples were poorly classified, permanent dentition presented increased levels of acetate, saccharides and propionate. The NMR data and PCA-LR were able to classify saliva from children with or without caries, with performance indexes comparable to the partial least-squares regression discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) results also performed.

  abstract = {Dental plaque bacteria form complex and robust cell aggregates which cannot be counted accurately using epifluorescence microscopy. This causes a significant problem for quantifying their viability. The aim of the investigation was to develop a fluorescence assay to quantify the viable biomass of dental plaque biofilms. Using an artificial mouth system, microcosm plaques were grown under a range of fluoride and mineralizing conditions, and were treated with the oral antiseptics chlorhexidine (CHX) and Listerine\textregistered. Plaques were harvested, made into suspension and stained in microtitre plates with a di-chromatic fluorescent stain (Live/Dead\textregistered{} BacLight\texttrademark ). The percentage of viable biomass was calculated from the regression data generated from a viability standard. The standard was constructed using different proportions of viable (green fluorescence) and non-viable (red fluorescence) plaque bacteria, and growth conditions for optimizing green fluorescence were investigated. The results from the assay showed that fluoride at 1000 and 3000 ppm promoted plaque viability by at least 15\%, from {$\sim$} 45 to 60\%, and at 5000 ppm to {$\sim$} 87\% (P b 0.05). Plaques treated with Listerine\textregistered{} and CHX from d 0 yielded insufficient biomass to be tested for viability, however 14 d post-treatment, viability was comparable to untreated plaques ({$\sim$} 55\%, P N 0.05). Treatment with Listerine\textregistered{} and CHX from d 3 reduced biomass but not viability. Development of this assay enabled viability of plaque bacteria which cannot be resolved with epifluorescence microscopy to be evaluated. It offers a rapid alternative to epifluorescence microscopy and could be applied to nonoral bacteria.},

  abstract = {Oral biofilms develop under a range of different conditions and different environments. This review will discuss emerging concepts in microbial ecology and how they relate to oral biofilm development and the treatment of oral diseases. Clues to how oral biofilms develop may lie in other complex systems, such as interactions between host and gut microbiota, and even in factors that affect biofilm development on leaf surfaces. Most of the conditions under which oral biofilms develop are tightly linked to the overall health and biology of the host. Advances in molecular techniques have led to a greater appreciation of the diversity of human microbiota, the extent of interactions with the human host, and how that relates to inter-individual variation. As a consequence, plaque development may no longer be thought of as a generic process, but rather as a highly individualized process, which has ramifications for the treatment of the diseases it causes.},

  abstract = {In vivo dental plaque biofilms consist of complex communities of oral bacteria that are a challenge to replicate in vitro. The aim of this investigation was to establish human dental plaque microcosms in microplates to reflect conditions that are relevant to dental caries. Microcosm plaque biofilms were initiated from the saliva of two different donors, grown for up to 10 days in 24-welled microplates on ThermanoxTM coverslips in various types of artificial saliva with and without sucrose, which were replaced daily. Microbiota composition of 40 species associated with oral health and dental caries was monitored in the plaques using Checkerboard DNA\textendash DNA hybridization analysis. pH was measured as an indicator of cariogenic potential. The composition of the saliva inocula was different, and yielded plaque microcosms with different composition and growth responses to sucrose. Artificial saliva type and presence of sucrose, and the resulting growth and pH conditions, modified the growth of individual species and hence the ecological profile of the microplate plaques during development. Complex population shifts were observed during development, and older plaques comprised predominantly facultative anaerobic species. Sucrose supplementation limited the decline of Streptococci over time but did not increase the abundance of mutans Streptococci. Sucrose at 0.15\% increased levels of caries-associated species including Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Actinomyces gerensceriae; these were further increased with sucrose at 0.5\%, in addition to Actinomyces israelii, Rothia dentocariosa and Capnocytophaga gingivalis. The microplate plaques demonstrated complex community dynamics that appeared to reflect the maturation of natural plaques, and sucrose induced a cariogenic plaque composition and pH.},

Eleven individuals from the Roman cemetery of San Donato and six from the medieval cemetery of San Pietro are presented and discussed. The results suggest a distinctive stability of the two populations, with most of the analysed individuals showing a local or regional origin. Carbon and nitrogen isotopes are indicative of a diet based on a mixed C3/C4 plant consumption and rich in animal proteins, with no significant difference between the Roman and the medieval populations. The consumption of C4 plants, more resilient to the Alpine climate, is consistently documented both by isotopes and dental calculus. Dental calculus results permit the characterisation of the typology of the crop consumed, namely millet, barley/wheat and legumes and may also suggest differing cooking processes between the Roman and the medieval periods. Phytoliths, vascular elements, fungal spores and animal remains from dental calculus provide new insights into the diet of the analysed individuals but also, hypothetically, into possible medicinal treatments. The presence of birds such as fowls and ducks in the medieval diet of some individuals from San Pietro has also emerged. Overall, the results of this study open a new window into the biographies of the individuals analysed, their diet, mobility, habits, and environment, thus stimulating further and more systematic investigation on the populations occupying an Alpine sector which is still poorly understood from an archaeological perspective.},

The recovery and identification of organic microremains entrapped within dental calculus provide new data regarding diet, health, and lifestyle. This paper presents, for the first time, microscopic evidence of the sporangium annulus of a fern within the dental calculus of an adult male from the medieval necropolis of Can Reiners (Balearic Islands, Spain). The sporangium evidence was compared with modern sporangia collected in northern Mallorca and the Iberian Peninsula. The results revealed that the features of the Can Reiners sporangium sample were compatible with the species Asplenium trichomanes. Through a historical and modern botanical literature review, it is known that this species has been widely regarded as a cure for kidney stones and alopecia. Moreover, this species was used as an expectorant, diuretic, and emmenagogue (herb that provokes menstruation or abortion). Considering that sporangia are attached to leaves and when they are mature only spores are released in the air, the presence of the annulus within dental calculus provides direct evidence of the consumption of ferns by the population living in the Balearic Islands during the Middle Ages. Although the use of these plants as constituents of diet is not attested, we may suggest that they could be employed as medicinal plants.},

  abstract = {In Part I is given a survey of the results of a statistical examination of the yield of the plots of Broadbalk ``Wheat field during 67 years. The main features of the comparison of mean yields are well known; the comparative rates of decrement, shown in Section 5, supply a class of facts well worthy of further study. Particularly striking are the relatively slow rates of decrement of plots 2               b               and 8, compared with plot 7, which would seem to show a permanent advantage in very high nitrogenous dressings, and to emphasise the need for caution in the application of the principle of diminishing returns. The evidence of the influence of potassium sulphate and its substitutes, sodium sulphate and magnesium sulphate, shown in Table V, is also very striking. An unsuspected feature of the changes of mean yields, which precludes the possibility of obtaining from these data true curves of exhaustion has appeared in the slow changes which have taken place in all the plots in a similar manner. In Part II the mathematical methods by which the variation has been analysed has been discussed, partly as a justification of novel procedure, partly, to make clear that the three types of variations found have been genuinely distinguished. In Part III such evidence as is available has been presented, in order to throw light upon the possibility that the changes in mean yield have been caused by variations in the prevalence of weeds at different periods.                          One point of importance which should be emphasised is that average wheat yields, even over long periods, from different fields or for different seasons cannot approach in accuracy the comparison of plots of the same field in the same seasons. The advantage of the method adopted by Lawes in the permanent experiments which he instituted is very evident. The effects of weather clearly require that the seasons should be identical, unless the series be very long, but the slow changes in mean yield show that even comparatively long series of different years from the same field cannot be accurately compared. Within the same field, however, the slow changes have almost proportional effects, and comparison between the mean yields of neighbouring plots may be made with great accuracy. The only case in which changes in mean yield sensibly affect the comparison of averages is that of plots 17 and 18. In comparing these with plots 3 and 4, 5, 7, and 10, it would be more accurate to confine attention to high yielding periods, at which the disturbing causes are at their minimum.             It is believed that the deviations from the smooth curves, which have been freed, for the most part, from the effects of exhaustion and weeds, form statistically homogeneous material for the study of meteorological effects.},

When phylogenetically placed, this genome falls in branch 3I among the diversity of other contemporary ancient strains from Northern Europe. Moreover, ancient mycobacterial peptides were retrieved via mass spectrometry-based proteomics, further validating the presence of the pathogen. Mycobacterium leprae can readily be detected in the oral cavity and associated mucosal membranes, which likely contributed to it being incorporated into this individual's dental calculus. This individual showed some possible, but not definitive, evidence of skeletal lesions associated with early-stage leprosy. This study is the first known example of successful multi-omics retrieval of M. leprae from archaeological dental calculus. Furthermore, we offer new insights into dental calculus as an alternative sample source to bones or teeth for detecting and molecularly characterizing M. leprae in individuals from the archaeological record.

The skeleton, which is fundamental for anthropologists and geneticists, could be useful also for toxicological purposes. The present study aims to examine what kind of information toxicological analysis performed on bones (the cranium and the ribs) in different states of preservation could provide to the forensic practitioner. Thirty cadavers with known pharmacological history, subjected to forensic autopsy at the Institute of Legal Medicine of Milan, were selected. Rib and cranium samples were collected from each body and separated into two parts in order to create two different states of preservation: One was cleaned from soft tissues and analyzed as a well-preserved bone sample; the other was submitted to a long maceration process, simulating complete skeletonization. All specimens were then processed with accelerated solvent extraction and the eluates analyzed using Q-Exactive\texttrademark{} Orbitrap\texttrademark{} Mass Spectrometer. The analysis of blood and skeletal matrices showed positive results for the tested substances in 63\% of cases, mainly benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and drug abuse. Significant Pearson correlations were observed between non-macerated vs. macerated bone samples: r = 0.79 for rib samples, r = 0.61 for cranium samples, and r = 0.69 for all bone samples. As a consequence, the positive results confirm the potential of the bone tissue as an alternative matrix in forensic toxicology, even in cases of extremely decomposed bodies. This study also highlighted important elements for reconstructing the biological profile in cases of forensic anthropological concern.},

The results showed a relationship between the enzymatic susceptibility and the size of the starch granules: smaller size of the starch granules resulted in a higher percentage of hydrolysis. A basic difference in the mode of action of enzymes on small and large granules was observed. Enzymatic attack on the large granules was characterized by considerable surface corrosion, mainly at the radial axis. For small granules, the enzymatic action occurred on the surface of the granules and was characterized by an erosion with solubilization of the granules. Chemical and physical analysis of the starches suggested that hydrolysis should occur mainly at the amorphous areas of the granules.},

These metabolites include polyphenolic compounds, the six so-called catechins, and the methyl-xanthine alkaloids caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline. Postharvest inactivation of phenol oxidases in green tea leaves prevents oxidation of the catechins, whereas postharvest enzyme-catalyzed oxidation (fermentation) of catechins in tea leaves results in the formation of four theaflavins as well as polymeric thearubigins. These substances impart the black color to black teas. Black and partly fermented oolong teas contain both classes of phenolic compounds. A need exists to develop a better understanding of the roles of polyphenolic tea compounds in food and medical microbiology. This overview surveys and interprets our present knowledge of activities of tea flavonoids and teas against foodborne and other pathogenic bacteria, virulent protein toxins produced by some of the bacteria, virulent bacteriophages, pathogenic viruses and fungi. Also covered are synergistic, mechanistic, and bioavailability aspects of the antimicrobial effects. Further research is suggested for each of these categories.

  abstract = {The morphology of supragingival and subgingival calculus on extracted teeth was studied with the scanning electron microscope. Oral, crevicular, and fracture surfaces were examined. Both subgingival and supragingival calculus had a heterogenous core covered by a soft, loose layer of microorganisms. On supragingival calculus this layer was dominated by filamentous microorganisms while subgingival calculus was covered by a mixture of cocci, rods and filaments. The supragingival covering of filaments was oriented with the filaments approximately perpendicular to and in direct contact with the underlying dense calculus. This arrangement was rarely seen subgingivally where there was no distinct pattern of orientation. Some of the specimens of sub- and supragingival calculus were treated with sodium-hypochlorite. These lost the soft covering, and channels the same size as the filamentous organisms were found penetrating into the calculus. They were oriented perpendicular to the surface in supragingival calculus but had no specific direction in subgingival calculus. The appearance of the channels supports the concept that calcification starts between the microorganisms in both subgingival and supragingival calculus.},

Salivary flow rate increased with increasing levels of each taste stimulus. At concentrations of equal taste intensity, citric acid evoked the highest flow rate, followed by sodium chloride and sucrose, while starch, in solution, had a minimal effect. Secretion rate patterns for total protein and alpha-amylase mirrored those of flow rate. The total protein and alpha-amylase concentrations of the saliva, and specific activity of alpha-amylase, were influenced by the type but not the concentration of stimulus, with citric acid stimulation resulting in the lowest concentrations and highest specific activity. Sodium ion (Na+) concentration generally increased with increasing stimulated flow rate, while K+, Ca++, and Mg++ concentrations remained relatively constant. Subjects with lower flow rates had a more concentrated saliva than those with high flow, except for Na+ concentration. Oral stimulation resulted in similar changes in protein and alpha-amylase secretion rates for the two groups.},

Since the visual diagnosis of exposed dentine has not yet been validated, the present study is a first attempt to investigate its accuracy and consistency. Sixty-one examiners (23 scientists, 18 university dentists and 20 dental students) were asked to diagnose 49 tooth areas with different grades of wear and to decide whether dentine was exposed (positive test) or not (negative test). Afterwards, the teeth were histologically evaluated. In 44 areas, dentine (also in all cases with minor wear) was exposed, and in 5 areas enamel was present. Overall sensitivity was 0.65, specificity 0.88 and the proportion of correct diagnoses was 0.67. The diagnosis `dentine is exposed' was about 5 times as likely and the diagnosis `dentine is not exposed' half as likely to come from an area with exposed dentine than from an enamel-covered area. The closeness of the visual diagnosis to the histological findings was only fair ({\fontencoding{LELA}\selectfont\char91} = 0.27), no significant impact of professional experience was found. For inter- and intra-examiner agreement, {\fontencoding{LELA}\selectfont\char91} was 0.28 and 0.55, respectively. It was concluded that the diagnosis of exposed dentine is difficult.}

Researchers have recently explored using bulk samples of dental calculus as a substitute for bone and dentine collagen in dietary analyses, because calculus can be sampled without causing damage to the teeth, and may be useful in situations where more destructive analyses are not possible, or where collagen is poorly preserved. Several questions remain about the use of bulk calculus as a source of carbon and nitrogen isotope data, however. It is not yet clear how much of an individual's life span dental calculus represents, what portions of the diet it records, and how diagenesis effects the carbon and nitrogen isotope values of this material. Most importantly, there have been no comparative studies of collagen and calculus isotope values, which are necessary to establish the value of bulk calculus as a source of accurate isotope values. Here we report the comparison of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses of bulk calculus to those from bone and dentine collagen. These analyses have been performed on individuals from the El Raval Mudejar Medieval Cemetery (Eastern Iberia, 15th century A.D.). Although calculus isotope values may be broadly similar to expected values at the population level, we report here no correlation between collagen and bulk dental calculus values at the individual level. As a result, we recommend that carbon and nitrogen analysis on bulk dental calculus should only be used as a last resource archaeological dietary marker, if at all.},

We examined the evidence for body mass, stature, limb proportions, body size and dental size dimorphism, and absolute and relative brain size in Homo naledi as represented in the Dinaledi Chamber sample. H.~naledi stature and body mass are low compared to reported values for H.~erectus, with the exception of some of the smaller bodied Dmanisi H.~erectus specimens, and overlap with larger Australopithecus and early Homo estimates. H. naledi endocranial volumes (465\textendash 560~cc) and estimates of encephalization quotient are also similar to Australopithecus and low compared to all Homo specimens, with the exception of Homo floresiensis (LB1) and the smallest Dmanisi H.~erectus specimen (D4500). Unlike Australopithecus, but similar to derived members of genus Homo, the Dinaledi assemblage of H.~naledi exhibits both low levels of body mass and dental size variation, with an estimated body mass index of sexual dimorphism less than 20\%, and appears to have an elongated lower limb. Thus, the H.~naledi bauplan combines features not typically seen in Homo species (e.g., small brains and bodies) with those characteristic of H.~erectus and more recent Homo species (e.g., reduced mass dimorphism, elongated lower limb).},

This study investigates potential biocultural reasons that may explain why this was the case. Material and Methods A total of 6,860 teeth and 9,889 alveoli from 363 permanent dentitions from the skeletal remains of impoverished adult Irish males and females who died between 1847 and 1851 in the Kilkenny Union Workhouse were examined for evidence of dental caries, periodontal disease and ante-mortem tooth loss. Caries rates were quantified and assessed by crude prevalence, frequencies, corrected caries rates and a t-health index, and evaluated by sex and age groups. Results A higher rate of caries was present among 18\textendash 25-year-old males than females, while the opposite relationship was evident for older age groups. The prevalence rates of periodontal disease and ante-mortem tooth loss increased with age. When assessed by corrected caries rates, tooth decay is observed at a lower rate compared to contemporaneous lower to upper-class population samples from London. Discussion Despite being low cariogenic foods, the potato starch and milk lactose of a nineteenth-century Irish laborer's diet would have lowered oral pH-values thereby increasing the risk of bacterial fermentation in dental plaque resulting in caries. Nutritional features alone cannot explain the high rates of dental caries observed in the Kilkenny workhouse population sample, however, and lifestyle factors, particularly habitual clay-pipe smoking, is considered a significant cause of poor oral health.},

Rather, we are pointing out that even large changes in significance levels can correspond to small, nonsignificant changes in the underlying quantities.The error we describe is conceptually different from other oft-cited problems\textemdash that statistical significance is not the same as practical importance, that dichotomization into significant and nonsignificant results encourages the dismissal of observed differences in favor of the usually less interesting null hypothesis of no difference, and that any particular threshold for declaring significance is arbitrary. We are troubled by all of these concerns and do not intend to minimize their importance. Rather, our goal is to bring attention to this additional error of interpretation. We illustrate with a theoretical example and two applied examples. The ubiquity of this statistical error leads us to suggest that students and practitioners be made more aware that the difference between ``significant'' and ``not significant'' is not itself statistically significant.},

  abstract = {A standard mode of inference in social and behavioral science is to establish stylized facts using statistical significance in quantitative studies. However, in a world in which measurements are noisy and effects are small, this will not work: selection on statistical significance leads to effect sizes which are overestimated and often in the wrong direction. After a brief discussion of two examples, one in economics and one in social psychology, we consider the procedural solution of open postpublication review, the design solution of devoting more effort to accurate measurements and within-person comparisons, and the statistical analysis solution of multilevel modeling and reporting all results rather than selection on significance. We argue that the current replication crisis in science arises in part from the ill effects of null hypothesis significance testing being used to study small effects with noisy data. In such settings, apparent success comes easy but truly replicable results require a more serious connection between theory, measurement, and data.},

One method often used to place input variables on a common scale is to divide each numeric variable by its standard deviation. Here we propose dividing each numeric variable by two times its standard deviation, so that the generic comparison is with inputs equal to the mean {$\pm$}1 standard deviation. The resulting coefficients are then directly comparable for untransformed binary predictors. We have implemented the procedure as a function in R. We illustrate the method with two simple analyses that are typical of applied modeling: a linear regression of data from the National Election Study and a multilevel logistic regression of data on the prevalence of rodents in New York City apartments. We recommend our rescaling as a default option\textemdash an improvement upon the usual approach of including variables in whatever way they are coded in the data file\textemdash so that the magnitudes of coefficients can be directly compared as a matter of routine statistical practice.

Whereas past research has found that people can judge others' grandiose narcissism from their appearance (including their faces), the cues supporting these judgments require further elucidation. Here, we investigated which facial features underlie perceptions of grandiose narcissism and how they convey that information. Method and Results In Study 1, we explored the face's features using a variety of manipulations, ultimately finding that accurate judgments of grandiose narcissism particularly depend on a person's eyebrows. In Studies 2A\textendash 2C, we identified eyebrow distinctiveness (e.g., thickness, density) as the primary characteristic supporting these judgments. Finally, we confirmed the eyebrows' importance in Studies 3A and 3B by measuring how much perceptions of narcissism changed when swapping narcissists' and non-narcissists' eyebrows between faces. Conclusions Together, these data show that distinctive eyebrows reveal narcissists' personality to others, providing a basic understanding of the mechanism through which people can identify narcissistic personality traits with potential application to daily life.},

Nevertheless, these criteria are not foolproof, and we believe that they have, in practice, replaced the use of thought and prudence when designing and executing ancient DNA studies. We argue here that researchers in this field must take a more cognitive and self-critical approach. Specifically, in place of checking criteria off lists, researchers must explain, in sufficient enough detail to dispel doubt, how the data were obtained, and why they should be believed to be authentic.},

In this study the levels of endogenous contamination (i.e. present within the sample prior to sampling for the DNA analysis) are assessed within human bone and teeth specimens sampled from the cemetery of Santa Lucia alle Malve, Matera, Italy. This site is of exceptional interest, because the samples have been assayed for 18 measures of biochemical and physical preservation, and it is the only one identified in a study of more than 107 animal and 154 human bones from 43 sites across Europe, where a significant number of human bones was well preserved. The findings demonstrate several important issues: (a) although teeth are more resilient to contamination than bone, both are readily contaminated (presumably through handling or washing), and (b) once contaminated in this way, both are difficult (if not impossible) to decontaminate. Furthermore, although assessed on bone samples, several of the specific biochemical and physical characteristics that describe overall sample preservation, levels of microbial attack and related increases in sample porosity directly correlate with the presence of observable contamination in both bone and teeth samples from individual samples. While we can only speculate on the cause of this relationship, we posit that they provide useful guides for the assessment of whether samples are likely to be contaminated or not.},

Stable isotope analysis was performed on 120 humans, 41 faunal specimens and 8 charred seeds. Dental calculus analyses were carried out on 94 samples. Overall, isotope data indicated an omnivorous diet based on C3-terrestrial protein, although some individuals possessed carbon values indicative of C4 plant consumption. In terms of animal protein, the diet was probably based on cattle, sheep, pig and chicken products, as witnessed by the archaeozoological findings. Evidence from calculus suggested the consumption of C3 cereals, Fabaceae, Fagaceae, milk and dairy products. Secondary metabolites of herbs and wine were also detected. The detection of marine fish ancient DNA, as well as of {$\omega$}3 fatty acids in calculus, hypothesized the consumption of marine foodstuffs for this coastal population, despite the lack of a clear marine isotopic signal and the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids in plant tissues. Moreover, the knowledge of ethnopharmacological tradition and the application of medicinal plants (e.g. Punica granatum L., Ephedra sp. L.) were also identified. The detection of artemisinin, known to have antimalarial properties, led to hypothesize the presence of malaria in the area. Altogether, the combined application of microscopy and biomolecular techniques provided an innovative reconstruction of Medieval lifeways in Central Italy.},

  abstract = {The analysis of starch grains from food-related archaeological artefacts and human dental calculus has provided evidence for the consumption of plant resources worldwide. Recently, and based on experimental research, starch grain analysis has also been used as a proxy to reconstruct food transformation in the archaeological record through the analysis of the damage produced on starch grains by different food-processing techniques such as grinding, boiling and fermentation. The prospect of identifying food transformation through starch grain analysis opens exciting avenues for exploring the cultural factors underlying culinary practices. However, the structural integrity of starch grains may be affected by a variety of depositional and post-depositional processes, including but not limited to food processing, so that in order to identify damage produced by food processing one would first need to discard potential damage occurred at later stages (e.g., in the burial environment, during laboratory processing and analysis, etc.). The identification of food processing through the analysis of the damage produced on starch grains is further obscured by equifinality and multifinality, as exemplified by un\- cooked modern reference material presented here showing damage patterns consistent with ``boiling'', ``spouting'' and ``fermenting''. Consequently, the identification of food transformation in the archaeological record through the analysis of the damage produced on starch grains needs to be supported by reliable contextual information, a representative number of samples and the existence of alternative sources of evidence (i.e., a multi-proxy approach).},

Our results indicate that while greater mean male height is associated with polygynous marriage, marriage practices did not exert an influence on the degree of sexual dimorphism of stature. On the other hand, the results suggest that while sexual dimorphism in height has a strong genetic component, dietary factors can influence the degree of dimorphism.}

That the inter-species boundary remained geographically localized for so long is a puzzle, particularly in light of the rapidity of its subsequent movement. Here, we propose that infectious-disease dynamics can explain the localization and persistence of the inter-species boundary. We further propose, and support with dynamical-systems models, that introgression-based~transmission of alleles related to the immune system would have gradually diminished this barrier to pervasive inter-species interaction, leading to the eventual release of the inter-species boundary from its geographic localization. Asymmetries between the species in the characteristics of their associated `pathogen packages' could have generated feedback that allowed modern humans to overcome disease burden earlier than Neanderthals, giving them an advantage in their subsequent spread into Eurasia.},

  abstract = {Delayed-onset infection is defined as infectious swelling and trismus accompanied by pain or the presence of suppuration starting approximately 30 days after surgery. This study aimed to describe the occurrence and potential predisposing factors of delayed-onset infection. A retrospective case-control study of 223 lower third molar surgeries was performed. Participants were selected from among 1102 outpatients who underwent surgery between January 2013 and June 2018 at Semmelweis University. The inclusion criterion for the case group was inflammation of the operated area after suture removal. Patients in the control group were healthy nonsmokers {$<$}26 years old who healed without complication. Statistical analysis was performed using the Shapiro-Wilk test, the Mann-Whitney U test, and Fisher's exact test. Complications occurred only in patients {$<$}26 years old approximately 29.5 days after surgery. A significantly higher risk was observed for younger age, total soft tissue coverage, deeper impaction, lower Nolla stage (P {$<$} .001), mesioangular direction (P = .002), and full bone coverage (P {$<$} .05). Distal space was inversely correlated with complications (P {$<$} .001). Lower Nolla stage, total soft tissue coverage, lack of distal space, deeper impaction, or mesioangular tilt may promote delayed-onset infection. Follow-up of at-risk patients and the maintenance of oral hygiene are recommended. To investigate the effect of mogroside, palatinose, erythritol, and xylitol on the dental plaque pH of children and to compare the plaque pH change between caries-active and caries-free children caused by these sweeteners. Thirty-six children (mean age 6.2 {$\pm$} 2.9-year-old), caries-active and caries-free, were included. After refraining from practicing oral hygiene, the accessible plaque was collected and equally divided for challenging with 6 different solutions: mogroside, palatinose, erythritol, xylitol, 10\% sucrose, and deionized water. The pH of each solution was measured using a digital pH meter at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min. Mogroside, erythritol, xylitol, and water did not significantly lower the dental plaque pH, however, palatinose reduced dental plaque pH comparable to sucrose (p {$<$} 0.05). Comparing the caries-active and caries-free groups, only sucrose produced significantly different pH value at min 5 and 10. Mogroside, erythritol, and xylitol did not lower the dental plaque pH in caries-active or caries-free children. However, palatinose affected the dental plaque pH similar to sucrose.},

Caries risk assessment (CRA) is a critical component of ECC management, yet the accuracy, consistency, reproducibility, and longitudinal validation of the available risk assessment techniques are lacking. Molecular and microbial biomarkers represent a potential source for accurate and reliable dental caries risk and onset. Next-generation nucleotide-sequencing technology has made it feasible to profile the composition of the oral microbiota. In the present study, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing was applied to saliva samples that were collected at 6-mo intervals for 24\,mo from a subset of 56 initially caries-free children from an ongoing cohort of 189 children, aged 1 to 3\,y, over the 2-y study period; 36 children developed ECC and 20 remained caries free. Analyses from machine learning models of microbiota composition, across the study period, distinguished between affected and nonaffected groups at the time of their initial study visits with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.71 and discriminated ECC-converted from healthy controls at the visit immediately preceding ECC diagnosis with an AUC of 0.89, as assessed by nested cross-validation. Rothia mucilaginosa, Streptococcus sp., and Veillonella parvula were selected as important discriminatory features in all models and represent biomarkers of risk for ECC onset. These findings indicate that oral microbiota as profiled by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing is predictive of ECC onset.},

Here, we outline the recent developments in the analysis of plant ancient DNA.

Further efforts towards the analysis of ancient DNA from the abundant store of fossil plant remains should provide new research opportunities in palaeoecology and phylogeography. In particular, intraspecific variation should be considered not only in cultivated plants but also in wild taxa if palaeogenetics is to become a fully emancipated field of plant research.},

The association between the salivary MMP-8 levels and periodontitis remained significant after the adjustment with age, gender and smoking. In addition, significant correlations were found between the tested markers and periodontal parameters. Conclusion Enzymes and end-products of type I collagen degradation have different associations with each other and with periodontal status that may reflect their roles in the cascade leading to alveolar bone loss.

All samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA\textendash DNA hybridization. The relationship between total DNA probe counts and microbial composition was examined by subsetting the data into 10 groups based on 10 percentile increments of the total DNA probe counts. Differences among groups in terms of species counts and proportions were sought, as well as relationships of total plaque DNA probe count and clinical parameters. Results: There was a wide distribution in mean total DNA probe counts among the 187 subjects. With increasing total plaque levels there was a change in the proportions of individual species and microbial complexes. `Small plaques' were characterized by high proportions of species in the yellow, orange, purple and `other' complexes; plaques of moderate mass were characterized by high proportions of Actinomyces and purple complex species, while `large plaques' exhibited increased proportions of green and orange complex species. Measures of gingival inflammation, pocket depth and recession were significantly positively associated with total DNA probe counts. Increased plaque numbers were related to increased pocket depth irrespective of presence or absence of gingival inflammation.

This study was designed to test the hypothesis that tooth location affects the microbial composition of supragingival plaque beyond the effect due to plaque mass as reflected by total DNA probe count. Material and Methods: Supragingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal aspect of each tooth in 187 subjects (n = 4745 samples). All samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA\textendash DNA hybridization. Significance of differences in mean species counts and proportions were determined among tooth surfaces and six tooth type categories: molars, bicuspids, incisors/canines in the mandible and maxilla separately using the Kruskal\textendash Wallis test. Stepwise multiple linear regression was employed to examine the relationship between species proportions and total DNA probe count, tooth location, periodontal and smoking status, age and sex. Results: All species differed significantly among tooth types and among the six tooth categories. Higher plaque levels were seen on molars and lower incisors. Some differences observed between tooth types could be partly explained by the level of plaque. Teeth with high plaque mass exhibited high levels of Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, Campylobacter rectus and Campylobacter showae. However, certain species, such as Veillonella parvula and Streptococcus sanguinis, differed significantly at different tooth locations despite similarities in plaque mass. Twenty of the test species exhibited a significant association with tooth location after adjusting for total DNA probe count and subject level factors. Conclusion: While plaque mass was associated with differences in proportions of many species in supragingival biofilms, tooth location also was strongly associated with species proportions in both univariate and multivariate analyses.},

The dominant species in the oral microbiome were verified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. Results The Han population, living at an altitude of 500 m, had higher microbiome diversity than the Zang population living at altitudes of 3000\textendash 4000 m. People living at 3000 m had a higher relative abundance of Leptothrix genus, but people living at 500 m had a higher relative abundance of Capnocytophaga genus according to Lefse difference analysis (P {$<$} 0.05). Compared to the Zang population, the Han population had higher relative abundances of Porphyromonas and Treponema genus organisms, especially Porphyromonas (P {$<$} 0.001). qPCR analysis confirmed that people living at high altitudes had the highest relative abundance of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P {$<$} 0.01).

Qesem Cave, Israel (420\textendash 200~ka) is a site that has produced evidence for a wealth of innovative features including controlled use of fire, represented by a repeatedly used hearth. Numerous charred bone and stone tools as well as wood ash have been found throughout the ten metres of archaeological deposits. Here, we describe the presence of a range of potentially inhaled, and ingested, materials extracted from samples of dental calculus from the Qesem Cave hominins. These finds offer an insight into the environment in and around the cave, while micro-charcoal highlights the need for smoke management in enclosed environments. Plant fibres and a phytolith may be evidence of oral hygiene activities or of using the teeth to work raw materials. Starch granules and chemical compounds provide a direct link to ingested plant food items. This extends the evidence for consumption of plant foods containing essential nutrients including polyunsaturated fatty acids and carbohydrates, into the Lower Palaeolithic. Together, these results represent a significant breakthrough towards a better understanding of Middle Pleistocene dietary breadth and highlight some of the challenges facing the adoption of the habitual use of fire for cooking by the Qesem Cave hominins, as well as offering an insight into their ecological knowledge and technological adaptability.},

  abstract = {Dental calculus is now widely used to recover information on items ingested in the past. It is particularly valuable in the earlier Paleolithic, where recovered data may represent the only evidence for plant use. Several recovery methods are used and each one produces different results. Biomolecular markers and genetic material recovered from dental calculus is providing new data on identifiable dietary and medicinal items and human microbial communities. The recovery of microfossils, in particular, starch granules, has triggered a new awareness of the role of plants in the diet throughout the Paleolithic. However, the minute amount of material recovered has little relationship with food eaten during a person's life, while salivary amylase breaks down cooked starch. Therefore, broader dietary interpretations and detection of cooked food are problematic. The study of ancient dental calculus holds great potential to recover information about past lives, within realistic parameters.},

This paper presents a review of the plant physiological and soil biochemical literature pertinent to the archaeological investigation of starch grains found as residues on artefacts and in archaeological sediments. Preservative and destructive factors affecting starch survival, including enzymes, clays, metals and soil properties, as well as differential degradation of starches of varying sizes and amylose content, were considered. The synthesis and character of chloroplast-formed `transitory' starch grains, and the differentiation of these from `storage' starches formed in tubers and seeds were also addressed. Findings of the review include the higher susceptibility of small starch grains to biotic degradation, and that protective mechanisms are provided to starch by both soil aggregates and artefact surfaces. These findings suggest that current reasoning which equates higher numbers of starch grains on an artefact than in associated sediments with the use of the artefact for processing starchy plants needs to be reconsidered. It is argued that an increased understanding of starch decomposition processes is necessary to accurately reconstruct both archaeological activities involving starchy plants and environmental change investigated through starch analysis.},

A two-way ANOVA, a component of the general linear model (GLM), was run to compare LEH prevalence to maximum femoral length, while accounting for time period and sex. The results showed a significant association in both samples between presence of LEH and femur length in males. The association did not differ between cemeteries, indicating no temporal change in the relationship. Examination of the distribution suggests the association was stronger in males than in females, a possible indication of superior female buffering in these samples. This research provides a look at how environmental stressors in childhood may have permanent effects on growth in past populations while also attempting to better understand how males and females may differ in buffering against episodes of stress.},

While it is known that calculus is very variable in chemical composition, crystallinity and crystallite size little is known about site specific variability within a dentition and between individuals. With this in mind, a study was undertaken to investigate the comparative site specific nature and composition of human dental supra-gingival dental calculus obtained from 66 male patients visiting for their dental check-up using fluorescent X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The supra-gingival dental calculus formed on the lingual surfaces of lower anterior teeth and the buccal surfaces of upper molar teeth were classified into four types based on calcium phosphate phases present. There was significant difference in composition of the crystal phase types between lower and upper teeth ( p {$<$} 0.01). There was no significant difference in crystal size between dental calculus on anterior or molar teeth of all samples. The degree of crystallinity of dental calculus formed on the upper molar teeth was higher than that formed on the lower anterior teeth ( p {$<$} 0.01). The CO32\`A contents in dental calculus formed on the lower anterior teeth were higher than on upper molar teeth ( p {$<$} 0.05) which might explain the difference in crystallinity. Magnesium and Si contents and Ca:P ratio on the other hand showed no significant difference between lower and upper teeth. It was concluded that the crystal phases, crystallinity and CO32\`A contents of human dental supra-gingival dental calculus is related to its location in the mouth.},

Previous analyses of proteins extracted from ancient dental calculus revealed the presence of the dietary milk protein {$\beta$}-lactoglobulin, providing direct evidence of dairy consumption in the archaeological record. However, the potential for calculus to preserve other food-related proteins has not yet been systematically explored. Here we analyse shotgun metaproteomic data from 100 archaeological dental calculus samples ranging from the Iron Age to the post-medieval period (eighth century BC to nineteenth century AD) in England, as well as 14 dental calculus samples from contemporary dental patients and recently deceased individuals, to characterize the range and extent of dietary proteins preserved in dental calculus. In addition to milk proteins, we detect proteomic evidence of foodstuffs such as cereals and plant products, as well as the digestive enzyme salivary amylase. We discuss the importance of optimized protein extraction methods, data analysis approaches and authentication strategies in the identification of dietary proteins from archaeological dental calculus. This study demonstrates that proteomic approaches can robustly identify foodstuffs in the archaeological record that are typically under-represented due to their poor macroscopic preservation.},

  abstract = {One of the most important challenges in anthropology is understanding the disappearance of Neanderthals. Previous research suggests that Neanderthals had a narrower diet than early modern humans, in part because they lacked various social and technological advances that lead to greater dietary variety, such as a sexual division of labor and the use of complex projectile weapons. The wider diet of early modern humans would have provided more calories and nutrients, increasing fertility, decreasing mortality and supporting large population sizes, allowing them to out-compete Neanderthals. However, this model for Neanderthal dietary behavior is based on analysis of animal remains, stable isotopes, and other methods that provide evidence only of animal food in the diet. This model does not take into account the potential role of plant food. Here we present results from the first broad comparison of plant foods in the diets of Neanderthals and early modern humans from several populations in Europe, the Near East, and Africa. Our data comes from the analysis of plant microremains (starch grains and phytoliths) in dental calculus and on stone tools. Our results suggest that both species consumed a similarly wide array of plant foods, including foods that are often considered low-ranked, like underground storage organs and grass seeds. Plants were consumed across the entire range of individuals and sites we examined, and none of the expected predictors of variation (species, geographic region, or associated stone tool technology) had a strong influence on the number of plant species consumed. Our data suggest that Neanderthal dietary ecology was more complex than previously thought. This implies that the relationship between Neanderthal technology, social behavior, and food acquisition strategies must be better explored.},

This study investigates population health during these transitions and interprets results within a framework of recent history and present-day public health information. We investigate skeletal evidence for anemia (cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis) as indicators of stress and frailty\textendash i.e., whether the lesions contribute to susceptibility for disease or increased risk of death. Methods The presence and severity of skeletal lesions were compared against known sex and cause of death data to investigate potential heterogeneity in frailty and the relationship between lesions and risk of dying over time. Additionally, we tested for the presence of selective mortality in our data (i.e., whether or not the sample is biased for individuals with higher frailty). Our sample derives from a large, documented, modern Portuguese collection from Lisbon and is the first study of its kind using a documented collection. The collection represents primarily middle-class individuals. Results and conclusions Analyses indicated that porotic hyperostosis became more common and severe over time, while cribra orbitalia severity increased over time. Neither process was linked to cause of death. However, there was a significant relationship to sex; males exhibited a higher prevalence and severity of lesions and increased mortality. A Gompertz function showed decreased survivorship in early life but increased survivorship over age 60. Using comorbidities of anemia, we were unable to detect selective mortality\textendash i.e., in our sample, lesions do not represent a sign of poor health or increased frailty and are not significantly linked with a decreased mean age-at-death. However, lesion prevalence and severity do reflect the socioeconomic processes in urban Lisbon during the 1800s and 1900s and the possibility of water-borne parasites as the contributing factor for iron deficiency anemia.},

It has no environmental reservoir and is believed to have co-evolved with its host over millennia. This is supported by skeletal evidence of the disease in early humans, and inferred from M. tuberculosis genomic analysis. Direct examination of ancient human remains for M. tuberculosis biomarkers should aid our understanding of the nature of prehistoric tuberculosis and the host/pathogen relationship. Methodology/Principal Findings We used conventional PCR to examine bone samples with typical tuberculosis lesions from a woman and infant, who were buried together in the now submerged site of Atlit-Yam in the Eastern Mediterranean, dating from 9250-8160 years ago. Rigorous precautions were taken to prevent contamination, and independent centers were used to confirm authenticity of findings. DNA from five M tuberculosis genetic loci was detected and had characteristics consistent with extant genetic lineages. High performance liquid chromatography was used as an independent method of verification and it directly detected mycolic acid lipid biomarkers, specific for the M. tuberculosis complex. Conclusions/Significance Human tuberculosis was confirmed by morphological and molecular methods in a population living in one of the first villages with evidence of agriculture and animal domestication. The widespread use of animals was not a source of infection but may have supported a denser human population that facilitated transmission of the tubercle bacillus. The similarity of the M. tuberculosis genetic signature with those of today gives support to the theory of a long-term co-existence of host and pathogen.}

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of food components, such as starch, soybean flour, fish meal, rapeseed oil, and coconut oil, on calcium phosphate precipitation were studied using a pH drop method. RESULTS: Although the addition of starch had no effect on the rate of precipitation of amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), it increased both the rate of transformation of ACP to hydroxyapatite (HAP) and the induction time (i.e. time for the initiation of transformation of ACP to HAP to occur); this was irrespective of the heat treatment of the starch. Amylopectin (insoluble constituent of starch) was effective in increasing the rate of HAP transformation, but amylose (soluble constituent of starch) was not. Oil specimen obtained from rapeseed (400 microl ml(-1)) increased the entire reaction of calcium phosphate precipitation, but that from coconut did not. Protein food, such as soybean flour and fish meal, decreased the rate of transformation of ACP to HAP and increased the induction time, while they had no effect on the rate of ACP precipitation. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that carbohydrate and oil (both are staple diets for the humans) enhance oral calcification (dental calculus formation or re-mineralization of tooth enamel), while side dishes of protein food would decrease it.},

Although the rate of amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) formation was not affected, the rate of transformation of ACP to hydroxyapatite (HAP) was either stimulated or inhibited by the different types of flour. The following observations were made: (1) When the lipid content below 0.2\% (w/w), any of the types of starch had a stimulatory effect on the transformation of ACP to HAP. (2) When the lipid content around or above 1.0\% (w/w), the value of the product of (protein content)   (mineral content) seems to determine the effect of starch.},

  abstract = {Dental caries is an important condition to record in archaeological collections, but the way in which recording is carried out has a large effect on the way in which the results can be interpreted. In living populations, dental caries is a disease that shows a strong relationship with age. Both the nature of carious lesions and their frequency change with successive age groups from childhood to elderly adulthood. There is also a progression in the particular teeth in the dentition which are most commonly affected and, in general, the molars and premolars are involved much more frequently than the canines and incisors. Lower teeth are usually affected more than upper, although the condition usually involves the right and left sides fairly equally. In the high tooth wear rate populations represented by many archaeological and museum collections, there is a complex relationship between the form of lesions and the state of wear, which adds yet another range of factors to the changing pattern of caries with increasing age. In the same populations, chipping, fracture and anomalous abrasion of teeth are also common, and these contribute similarly to the distribution and forms of carious lesion observed. Amongst the living, the pattern of ante-mortem tooth loss is important in understanding caries and, in archaeological material, there is also the complicating factor of post-mortem tooth loss. Finally, there is the question of diagnosis. There are diagnostic problems even in epidemiological studies of living patients and, for archaeological specimens, diagenetic change and the variable preservation of different parts of the dentition add further complications. For all these reasons, it is difficult to define any one general index of dental caries to represent the complete dentition of each individual, which would be universally suitable for studying a full range of collections from archaeological sites or museums. Variation in the nature of collections, their preservation, tooth wear, and ante-mortem and post-mortem tooth loss mean that when such a general index appears to differ between sites, there could be many other reasons for this, in addition to any genuine differences in caries incidence and pattern that might have been present. It is suggested here that the best approach is instead to make comparisons separately for each tooth type, age group, sex, lesion type and potential lesion site on the tooth.

  abstract = {GrowthMany age estimation methods are based on growth of the dentition and skeleton. Growth follows a consistent sequence, broadly comparable between different individuals, and clear-cut changes occur over a short period so, even taking into account variation within species, age can be estimated with reasonable precision from the state of development. Growth unfolds in different ways for different parts of the body. General or somatic growth is rapid in foetal and early postnatal life, but then slows until the `growth spurt' of puberty, during which any marker of overall body size increases rapidly. On the attainment of sexual maturity, growth rate falls back as the individual reaches adult size. Genital organs and most secondary sexual characters grow little before puberty, but very rapidly during the somatic growth spurt. Neural structures, by contrast, grow rapidly before birth and during infancy, after which they grow more slowly. Teeth and jaws have their own pattern related to the two dentitions. The deciduous dentition is associated with the shorter face or snout of young animals. Establishment of the permanent dentition is accompanied by elongation of the snout and the eruption of the last teeth marks attainment of adult face proportions.Skeletal structures obey one or a mixture of growth patterns. Long bone length follows the somatic pattern, whereas the skull is a complex mixture of growth curves (Moore, 1974; Osborn, 1981; Goose \&amp; Appleton, 1982; Enlow \&amp; Hansen, 1996; Meikle, 2002).},

To fill this knowledge gap, archaeobotanical data from cesspits dating to the period ad 1500\textendash 1850 contained in the Dutch Relational Archaeobotanical Database were analysed. First, edible plant taxa were distinguished from medicinal plants and potentially edible weeds. Then, seeds and fruits were distinguished from pollen. Finally, the remains were quantified to form an overview of the plant taxa consumed per urban settlement and, from there, to provide insight into regional and temporal changes in plant food availability and preferences. The combined archaeobotanical dataset, consisting of cesspit material from 51 cities, comprised 97 edible plant taxa. Surprisingly, 20 of these taxa are consistently present in 50\textendash 100\% of all settlements in the 350 years under study. Based on the archaeobotanical finds from the cesspits, we conclude that the overall plant food consumption of Early Modern Dutch urban inhabitants does not seem to have changed very much over time.},

However, the use of vertebral discriminant functions (DFs) in forensic anthropology and bioarchaeology is limited due to the unknown degree of their population specificity. Additionally, the performance of vertebral DFs has not yet been assessed at higher posterior probability thresholds. In this study, we tested the performance of previously published DFs for sex classification from Th12 and L1 vertebrae within a range of 0.5-0.95 posterior probabilities in a model of geographically distant population based on an autopsy Central European (CE) sample (Czech Republic; n=72) from the 1930s. Further, we derived new pooled DFs from a sample representing ecogeographically diverse populations, new DFs derived from the autopsy CE sample, and new Medieval CE DFs derived from the Pohansko sample (n=129) and evaluated their performance at our testing autopsy CE sample. Most vertebral measurements showed population specificity in sex assessment. However, we identified two Th12 measurements (anteroposterior body diameter and mediolateral body diameter) usable for sex estimation across populations. We showed that the accuracy of vertebral DFs can be increased to 95\% of correctly classified individuals in up to 64\% of the studied sample by setting a higher posterior probability threshold. Finally, we showed that even the DFs derived from relatively small subsamples (30\% of the population size) can provide accurate sex classification. This finding highlights the applicability of the hybrid approach in sex classification from vertebrae. To facilitate sex classification from vertebrae, we provide a software tool for sex classification from any vertebral measurement and reference samples tested in this study including the previously published DFs.},

We hypothesize that sex-differentiated genetic effects are contributors of these phenotypic differences. Focusing on a collection of drug metabolism enzymes and transporters (DMET) genes, we discover sex-differentiated genetic regulatory mechanisms between these genes and human complex traits. Here, we show that sex-differentiated genetic effects were present at genome-level and at DMET gene regions for many human complex traits. These sex-differentiated regulatory mechanisms are reflected in the levels of gene expression and endogenous serum biomarkers. Through Mendelian Randomization analysis, we identify putative sex-differentiated causal effects in each sex separately. Furthermore, we identify and validate sex differential gene expression of a subset of DMET genes in human liver samples. We observe higher protein abundance and enzyme activity of CYP1A2 in male-derived liver microsomes, which leads to higher level of an active metabolite formation of clozapine, a commonly prescribed antipsychotic drug. Taken together, our results demonstrate the presence of sex-differentiated genetic effects on DMET gene regulation, which manifest in various phenotypic traits including disease risks and drug responses.},

ADS activity in dental plaque varies greatly between individuals, which may profoundly affect their susceptibility to caries. Objective: To investigate the effect of arginine on the growth and biofilm formation of oral bacteria. Methods and results: Polymicrobial dental biofilms derived from saliva were formed in a high-throughput active attachment biofilm model and L-arginine (Arg) was shown to reduce the colony forming units (CFU) counts of such biofilms grown for various periods or biofilms derived from saliva of subjects with different caries status. Arg hardly disturbed bacterial growth of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus gordonii in BHI medium, but only inhibited biofilm formation of S. mutans. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed S. mutans biofilms harboured fewer cells grown with Arg than that without Arg, even in the initial 2 h and 8 h phase. Confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) images of poly-microbial dental and S. mutans biofilms revealed the biofilms grown with Arg had lower exopolysaccharide (EPS)/bacteria ratios than those without Arg (P = 0.004, 0.002, respectively). Arg could significantly reduce the production of waterinsoluble EPS in S. mutans biofilms (P {$<$} 0.001); however, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) did not show significantly influence in gene expression of gtfB, gtfC or gtfD (P = 0.32, 0.06, 0.44 respectively). Conclusions: Arg could reduce the biomass of poly-microbial dental biofilms and S. mutans biofilms, which may be due to the impact of Arg on water-insoluble EPS. Considering the contribution to pH homeostasis in dental biofilms, Arg may serve as an important agent keeping oral biofilms healthy thus prevent dental caries.},

The current study assessed various parameters associated with ammonium produced during arginine catabolism in dental biofilms. Polymicrobial biofilms were formed with saliva as the inoculum. The NH3 level and the pH of the spent medium were used to monitor and quantitate the bacterial reactions. The presence of sucrose, a low buffer capacity, and a low pH ({$\leq$} pH 4.5) were found to hamper alkali production from arginine. The rate of alkali production exhibited an optimum around pH 5.5. Biofilms were found to produce NH3 also from polypeptides and proteins in the medium. The biofilm age affected these processes. The experimental model proved valuable for the assessment of the collective bacterial reactions determining the overall pH outcome. This experimental approach could bridge the gap in our knowledge between pH-rise phenomena and caries susceptibility from clinical observations and studies performed on alkali-producing bacteria in wellcontrolled, though simplified, in vitro models. Analysis of our data supports the hypothesis that the initiation and progression of dental caries may be influenced by the relative rates of acid and base formation, which critically depend on the aforementioned parameters.},

  abstract = {Human saliva contains a large number of proteins and peptides (salivary proteome) that help maintain homeostasis in the oral cavity. Global analysis of human salivary proteome is important for understanding oral health and disease pathogenesis. In this study, large-scale identification of salivary proteins was demonstrated by using shotgun proteomics and two-dimensinal gel electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (2-DE-MS). For the shotgun approach, whole saliva proteins were prefractionated according to molecular weight. The smallest fraction, presumably containing salivary peptides, was directly separated by capillary liquid chromatography (LC). However, the large protein fractions were digested into peptides for subsequent LC separation. Separated peptides were analyzed by on-line electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using a quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometer, and the obtained spectra were automatically processed to search human protein sequence database for protein identification. Additionally, 2-DE was used to map out the proteins in whole saliva. Protein spots\hspace{0.25em}105 in number were excised and in-gel digested; and the resulting peptide fragments were measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry and sequenced by LC-MS/MS for protein identification. In total, we cataloged 309\,proteins from human whole saliva by using these two proteomic approaches.}

  abstract = {The microbiota of the human lower intestinal tract helps maintain healthy host physiology, for example through nutrient acquisition and bile acid recycling, but specific positive contributions of the oral microbiota to host health are not well established. Nitric oxide (NO) homeostasis is crucial to mammalian physiology. The recently described entero-salivary nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway has been shown to provide bioactive NO from dietary nitrate sources. Interestingly, this pathway is dependent upon oral nitrate-reducing bacteria, since humans lack this enzyme activity. This pathway appears to represent a newly recognized symbiosis between oral nitrate-reducing bacteria and their human hosts in which the bacteria provide nitrite and nitric oxide from nitrate reduction. Here we measure the nitrate-reducing capacity of tongue-scraping samples from six healthy human volunteers, and analyze metagenomes of the bacterial communities to identify bacteria contributing to nitrate reduction. We identified 14 candidate species, seven of which were not previously believed to contribute to nitrate reduction. We cultivated isolates of four candidate species in single- and mixed-species biofilms, revealing that they have substantial nitrate- and nitrite-reduction capabilities. Colonization by specific oral bacteria may thus contribute to host NO homeostasis by providing nitrite and nitric oxide. Conversely, the lack of specific nitratereducing communities may disrupt the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway and lead to a state of NO insufficiency. These findings may also provide mechanistic evidence for the oral systemic link. Our results provide a possible new therapeutic target and paradigm for NO restoration in humans by specific oral bacteria.},

Whether X-ray computed [micro-] tomography ([{$\mu$}]CT) imaging of these fossils may further damage aDNA remains debated. Although the effect of X-ray on DNA in living organisms is well documented, its impact on aDNA molecules is unexplored. Here we investigate the effects of synchrotron X-ray irradiation on aDNA from Pleistocene bones. A clear correlation appears between decreasing aDNA quantities and accumulating X-ray dose-levels above 2000\,Gray (Gy). We further find that strong X-ray irradiation reduces the amount of nucleotide misincorporations at the aDNA molecule ends. No representative effect can be detected for doses below 200\,Gy. Dosimetry shows that conventional {$\mu$}CT usually does not reach the risky dose level, while classical synchrotron imaging can degrade aDNA significantly. Optimised synchrotron protocols and simple rules introduced here are sufficient to ensure that fossils can be scanned without impairing future aDNA studies.},

  abstract = {In this study, we describe the dental health of four prehistoric human populations from the southern coast of Peru, an area in which independent archaeological evidence suggests that the practice of coca-leaf chewing was relatively common. A repeated pattern of cervical-root caries accompanying root exposure was found on the buccal surfaces of the posterior dentition, coinciding with the typical placement of coca quids during mastication. To further examine the association between caries patterning and coca chewing, caries site characteristics of molar teeth were utilized as indicators for estimating the likelihood of coca chewing for adults within each of the study samples. Likelihood estimates were then compared with results of a test for coca use derived from hair samples from the same individuals. The hair and dental studies exhibited an 85.7\% agreement. Thus, we have demonstrated the validity of a hard-tissue technique for identifying the presence of habitual coca-leaf chewing in ancient human remains, which is useful in archaeological contexts where hair is not preserved. These data can be used to explore the distribution of coca chewing in prehistoric times. Simultaneously, we document the dental health associated with this traditional Andean cultural practice.

In order to gather information about the health, diet and way of life of people in JABII, a paleoparasitological, paleogenetic, and micro-human remains investigation was carried out. Pelvic region and environmental control samples from six individuals exhumed from JABII were submitted to microscopic and ancient DNA (aDNA) investigation. Paleoparasitological analyses based on light microscopy were negative. However, a variety of informative microremains were found. Diatoms, fish scales, and algae characterize the marine and estuarine environment. Ipomoea batatas and Zea mays starch grains suggested cultivated items as part of their diet in agreement with the literature. The finding of Podocarpus sp. pollen grain, characteristic of highlander vegetation, suggests human mobility of JABII individuals which were settlement in the coast. Paleogenetic analyses showed Ascaris sp. helminth infection based on nad1 gene fragment detected from an individual excavated at L3 FS7 burial (1826\,{$\pm$}\,40 BP). This aDNA result places the antiquity of Ascaris sp. infection, and haplotypes that are circulating in humans and other animals nowadays, in Pre-Columbian South American times.},

Clinical and, to a much lesser extent, dental anthropological research have focused predominantly on prevalence (0.03\%-0.74\% in several world populations) and case studies, albeit on a restricted spatiotemporal scale. Many regions have received little attention, including sub-Saharan Africa, while premodern data are few. Here, the aim is to supplement both fields of dental research by reviewing previous publications, and newly reporting transposition rates, types, and co-occurring abnormalities in time-successive samples across the subcontinent. Methods: Dental data in 51 sub-Saharan samples ({$>$}2500 individuals) dating {$>$}10 000 BC to 20th century were recorded. Of these, 36 are of modern and 15 premodern age, comprising males and females {$\geq$}12-years of age. Transposition presence, quadrant, and type were tabulated, cases described, and prevalence presented. In the latter case, Poisson 95\% confidence intervals were calculated to better discern true population rates at various geographic levels. Results: Overall, six of 1886 modern individuals (0.32\%) and one of premodern age evidence Mx.C.P1, an exchange of the maxillary canine and first premolar. Various associated dental abnormalities are also evident, including retained deciduous teeth, reduced permanent crowns, and agenesis. Conclusions: This study provides additional insight into the geographic distribution, features, and time depth of transposition, along with hints supporting a genetic etiology and, potentially, some indications of diachronic change from an initial Mx.C.P1 to several types more recently based on premodern evidence. It is of clinical concern today, but is not just a modern anomaly.},

The major constituent of biofilm other than bacterial cells is the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix, which is secreted by the bacterial cells themselves.

Molecular phylogeny confirmed these two isolates as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis. It was observed that cell attachment in both the strains was maximal when xylose was used as the sole carbon source. The EPS characterization result indicated the presence of a macromolecular complex constituting of carbohydrate, protein, lipids and nucleic acids. Test for biofilm formation in the presence of metal salts of iron and zinc showed moderate to high inhibition of biofilm formation. However, calcium, iron and copper have been found to enhance biofilm growth significantly. There was more than 50 \% increase in biofilm growth by P. aeruginosa with an increase in calcium concentration up to 80 ppm (Two tailed t-test P{$<$}0.05), whereas {$\geq$} 15 \% increase in biofilm growth by B. subtilis was observed in the presence of 80 ppm of calcium.

The objective of this study was to determine the difference in caries and fluorosis levels following introduction of these 2 policy measures. A before-and-after study compared caries and fluorosis in random samples of 8-y-olds in Dublin (n = 707) and Cork-Kerry (n = 1148) in 2017 with 8-y-olds in Dublin (n = 679) and Cork-Kerry (n = 565) in 2002. Dentinal caries experience (primary teeth, d3vcmft(cde)) and fluorosis (permanent teeth, Dean's index of very mild or higher) were clinically measured. Lifetime exposure to community water fluoridation (CWF) was classified as ``full CWF''/``no CWF.'' Effect of examination year on caries prevalence and severity and fluorosis prevalence was assessed using multivariate regression adjusting for other explanatory variables. There was little change in commencement of fluoride toothpaste use at {$\leq$}24\,mo following introduction of toothbrushing guidance. Among children with full CWF, there was no statistically significant difference in caries prevalence or severity between 2017 and 2002. In 2017, caries prevalence was 55\% in Dublin (full CWF) and 56\% in Cork-Kerry (full CWF), and mean d3vcmft(cde) among children with caries was 3.4 and 3.7, respectively. Caries severity was less in 2017 (mean 4.2) than 2002 (mean 4.9) among children with no CWF (P = 0.039). The difference in caries severity between children with full CWF and no CWF was less in 2017 than in 2002 (interaction P = 0.013), suggesting a reduced benefit for CWF in 2017. In 2017, fluorosis prevalence was 18\% in Dublin (full CWF) and 12\% in Cork-Kerry (full CWF). Fluorosis was predominantly ``very mild'' with no statistically significant difference between 2017 and 2002. CWF at 0.6 to 0.8 ppm is an effective caries-preventive measure. Results suggested low uptake of toothbrushing guidance, a reduced caries-preventive effect for CWF in primary teeth, and no reduction in fluorosis following introduction of the policy measures.},

Understanding the ecology of oral biofilm communities, and how different species communicate within a given host, will inform new strategies for treatment and prevention of oral diseases. Advances in sequencing technologies have fuelled an increasing trend towards global genomic and proteomic approaches to determine the key factors that initiate oral diseases. Whilst metabolic profiling seeks to identify phenotypic changes of whole microbial communities, transcriptomic studies are exploring their complex interactions with each other and the host.

  abstract = {The consumption of coca tea is a common occurrence in many South American countries. The tea is often packaged in individual servings as tea bags which contain approximately 1 g of plant material. The consumption of coca tea leads to ingestion of cocaine and other alkaloids: however, there is little information available regarding the pharmacological or toxicological effects that result from consumption of coca tea. We performed a series of studies with coca tea bags from two South American countries, Peru and Bolivia. The alkaloidal content of the `coca leaf' in coca tea bags was determined by two different extraction methods: Soxhlet extraction with methanol (exhaustive extraction), and mechanical agitation with methanol. Extracts were purified by solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Coca tea prepared from Peruvian and Bolivian coca tea bags was also analyzed by SPE-GC/MS assay. In addition, urine specimens were analyzed from an individual who consumed one cup of Peruvian coca tea and one cup of Bolivian coca tea on separate occasions. Urine samples were analyzed by immunoassay (TDxR) and SPE-GC/MS. Analysis of coca tea bags and coca tea indicated that cocaine, benzoylecgonine, ecgonine methyl ester and trans-cinnamoylcocaine were present in varying quantities. With exhaustive extraction, an average of 5.11 mg, and 4.86 mg of cocaine per tea bag were found in coca leaf from Peru and Bolivia, respectively. The average amounts of benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester in Peruvian coca leaf were 0.11 and 1.15 mg, and in Bolivian coca leaf were 0.12 and 2.93 mg per tea bag, respectively. trans-Cinnamoylcocaine was found in trace amounts in Peruvian tea bags and 0.16 mg/tea bag of Bolivian tea. When tea was prepared, an average of 4.14 mg of cocaine was present in a cup of Peruvian coca tea and 4.29 mg of cocaine was present in Bolivian tea. Following the consumption of a cup of Peruvian tea by one individual, a peak urine benzoylecgonine concentration of 3940 ng/ml occurred 10 h after ingestion. Consumption of Bolivian coca tea resulted in a peak benzoylecgonine concentration of 4979 ng/ml at 3.5 h. The cumulative urinary excretion of benzoylecgonine after approximately 48 h, determined by GC/MS, was 3.11 mg and 2.69 mg after consumption of Peruvian and Bolivian coca tea, respectively. This study demonstrated that coca tea bags and coca tea contain a significant amount of cocaine and cocaine-related alkaloids and the consumption of a single cup of Peruvian or Bolivian coca tea produces positive drug test results for cocaine metabolites.},

Up until fairly recently, the associations between the host and oral bacteria were considered in terms of a multiplicity of single species interactions. However, it is becoming more apparent that the oral microbes comprize a complex community, and that oral health or disease depends on the interface between the host and the microbial community as a whole. Although it is important to continue studies of the pathogenic properties of specific microbes, these are relevant only in the context of the properties of the community within which they reside. Understanding the microbial communities that drive sickness or health is a key to combating human oral diseases.},

Here we present a complete ancient human genome and oral microbiome sequenced from a 5700 year-old piece of chewed birch pitch from Denmark. We sequence the human genome to an average depth of 2.3\texttimes{} and find that the individual who chewed the pitch was female and that she was genetically more closely related to western hunter-gatherers from mainland Europe than hunter-gatherers from central Scandinavia. We also find that she likely had dark skin, dark brown hair and blue eyes. In addition, we identify DNA fragments from several bacterial and viral taxa, including Epstein-Barr virus, as well as animal and plant DNA, which may have derived from a recent meal. The results highlight the potential of chewed birch pitch as a source of ancient DNA.},

Here, we use quantitative metaproteomics to characterize the dental calculus associated with the remains of 21 humans retrieved during the archeological excavation of the medieval (ca. 1100\textendash 1450 CE) cemetery of Tj\ae rby, Denmark. We identify 3671 protein groups, covering 220 bacterial species and 81 genera across all medieval samples. The metaproteome profiles of bacterial and human proteins suggest two distinct groups of archeological remains~corresponding to health-predisposed and oral disease-susceptible individuals, which is supported by comparison to the calculus metaproteomes of healthy living individuals. Notably, the groupings identified by metaproteomics are not apparent from the bioarchaeological analysis, illustrating that quantitative metaproteomics has the potential to provide additional levels of molecular information about the oral health status of individuals from archeological contexts., Mineralized plaque, or dental calculus, is a valuable reservoir of the ancient oral microbiome. Here, the authors use quantitative metaproteomics to analyze the dental calculus of 21 individuals from a medieval cemetery, identifying human and microbial proteins that shed light on their oral health status.},

  abstract = {Research increasingly suggests that natural and social environments shaped the Neolithic expansion of the farming niche into Europe. The Danube Gorges, on account of its position between the Mediterranean and more temperate regions and the presence of archaeological sites with continuous Mesolithic and Neolithic layers of occupation associated with vast burial grounds is ideal for studying the modality of Neolithization. Previous dietary stable isotope (carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur) studies in the Central Balkan area indicate that many Neolithic humans remained reliant on foraged aquatic resources in the Gorges. Until now, there is no unambiguous evidence of cereal consumption in this region. The possibility that the rich aquatic resources of the Danube river habitats within Central Balkans influenced diet and thus delayed uptake of Neolithic cultigens is unanswered. The extensive skeletal record from sites in the Danube Gorges (Central Balkans) with its long temporal sequence, provides the opportunity to reconstruct plant use during Mesolithic and the Neolithic. To assess when cereals and possibly cultivated plants spread to the region, we analysed the microbotanical remains (starch grains and phytoliths) entrapped in the dental calculus of 81 individuals dating from 9100 to 5500~cal BC, recovered from five sites in the Danube Gorges. This study marks the largest study of dental calculus from this period so far conducted. Added to this, we present new radiocarbon dates (n~=~17), bone collagen stable isotope data ({$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N; n~=~5) and data on caries frequency. This dietary study identifies that the growing of crops commenced in the Early Neolithic circa 6000~cal BC and was brought by farming migrants of north-western Anatolian ancestry into the Danube Gorges. Despite bringing a Neolithic agro-pastoral subsistence practices and cultural novelties in the Gorges, these migrants and their descendants adopted some of the local dietary and cultural traditions, suggesting a mosaic pattern of Neolithization. The resulting data provides a better understanding of the tempo and spread of cereal agriculture practices and the role of cereals in the diet of Danube Gorges inhabitants.},

  abstract = {Earlier studies (Kashket et al., 1991) showed that particles of high-starch snack foods remained longer on the teeth than those of high-sucrose, low-starch foods. The question arose whether the prolonged presence of food particles enhances cariogenicity. A study was undertaken to measure sugars, starches, and metabolic acids in retained food particles. Subjects consumed portions of different foods, and particles were removed from all bicuspids and first molars at defined times after swallowing. Dry weights, sugars, and short-chain carboxylic acids were determined. High-sucrose foods were cleared rapidly from the teeth, while high-starch foods were retained for up to 20 min. Sucrose, glucose, and fructose persisted in the retained particles. Particles of high-starch foods accumulated maltose and maltotriose, presumably from the breakdown of starch by salivary amylase. At maximum, maltose plus maltotriose constituted 94\% of total sugars in particles of potato chips; corresponding values in doughnuts, peanut butter cookies, and salted crackers were 43, 51, and 61\%, respectively. Total fermentable sugars in the particles of high-starch foods were similar to those for the high-sucrose confectionery products. Carboxylic acids accumulated within the particles, presumably due to the fermentation of the sugars by entrapped salivary micro-organisms. At maximum (5 to 7 min), acetic, formic, lactic, and propionic acids rose 17-, 30-, 15-, and 1.3-fold, respectively, in dough-nuts, and to smaller degrees in potato chips, salted crackers, and chocolatecaramel-peanut bars. In summary, the study demonstrated the persistence of sugars, the progressive accumulation of starch breakdown products, and the fermentation of the accumulated sugars in retained food particles. The findings support the view that high-starch foods contribute to the development of caries lesions.},

  abstract = {When dental health professionals advise that sticky foods be avoided, it is left to the consumer to choose correctly among different foods. In this study, comparisons were made among consumer ratings of stickiness of 21 commercially available foods and objective measurements of tooth retention of each of the foods. No correlation was found between the two, and neither the rates of clearance of food particles from the teeth nor the rates of clearance of food-derived sugars from the saliva correlated with ratings of food stickiness. Cookies, crackers, and potato chips were most retentive, whereas caramels, jelly beans, raisins, and milk chocolate bars were among those poorly retained. Clearance rates appeared to vary inversely with initial retention. However, chocolate-caramel bars exhibited high initial retention and a very rapid rate of clearance from the teeth. The findings show that consumers cannot accurately assess the retentiveness of foods and, thus, the advice simply to avoid sticky ones is inadequate.},

We generated genome-wide data for three individuals, and show their affinity to the Scandinavian hunter\textendash gatherers.

Good preservation of ancient DNA in historical dental calculus samples has provided reliable insight into the composition of the oral microbiome of postmedieval Latvian individuals. The relative stability of the classifiable oral microbiome composition was observed. Significant differences between the microbiome profiles of dental calculus and dental plaque samples were identified, suggesting microbial adaptation to a specific human body environment.},

Critical to biofilm formation is the eps operon, which is believed to be responsible for the biosynthesis of an exopolysaccharide that binds chains of cells together in bundles. We report that transcription of eps is under the negative regulation of SinR, a repressor that was found to bind to multiple sites in the regulatory region of the operon. Mutations in sinR bypassed the requirement in biofilm formation of two genes of unknown function, ylbF and ymcA, and sinI, which is known to encode an antagonist of SinR. We propose that these genes are members of a pathway that is responsible for counteracting SinR-mediated repression. We further propose that SinR is a master regulator that governs the transition between a planktonic state in which the bacteria swim as single cells in liquid or swarm in small groups over surfaces, and a sessile state in which the bacteria adhere to each other to form bundled chains and assemble into multicellular communities.},

These have been characterized in terms of their susceptibility to a series of protease inhibitors. The submandibular saliva proteases were shown to be sensitive to both serine and acidic protease inhibitors. We also used protease inhibitors to determine if salivary proteolytic activity was involved in the inhibition of HIV infectivity seen when the virus is incubated with human saliva. This anti-HIV activity has been reported to occur in whole saliva and in ductal saliva obtained from both the parotid and submandibular glands, with highest levels of activity present in the latter fluid. Protease inhibitors, at concentrations sufficient to block salivary proteolytic activity in an in vitro infectivity assay, did not block the anti-HIV effects of saliva, suggesting that the salivary proteases are not responsible for the inhibition of HIV-1 infectivity.},

In the same sample, significant (P {$<$} 0.001) differences in hardness (determined by microhardness testing) were observed between enamel and coronal dentine as well as between outer and inner enamel and dentine, respectively. In animals belonging to the same age group (three-year-olds, n= 11), a negative correlation (r= -0.830, P= 0.0016) was found between wear index and maximum mean enamel hardness. In a sample of five specimens from this age group, a negative correlation (r= -0.918, P= 0.028) between maximum calcium concentration of enamel (measured by electron microprobing) and wear index was also recorded. We concluded that the intensity of enamel mineralization had a decisive effect on the degree of dental wear. Measuring of enamel hardness and subsequent modification of wear scores or indices is therefore recommended for future studies on the relationship between age and the degree of dental attrition in deer.}

Occlusal microwear was also investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and, finally, the occlusal slope was determined at the level of the first molar teeth. The general pattern of wear was one of severe occlusal reduction with no significant differences between males and females. Both silicone impressions and SEM views confirmed a large component (30\%) of erosion. While most individuals had flat wear planes, 33\% of males and 44\% of females showed reversed Monson's curves. Accentuated Monson's curves were found in 23.8\% of males. While these results confirm early studies of the excessive wear experienced by pre-contact Maori, our study shows for the first time that erosion played a significant role in the dental wear of these people.

The tooth specimens in group 1 were incubated with E. faecalis for periods of 2-, 4-, and 6-week intervals and the chemical composition of the biofilm was determined using X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The tooth specimens in group 2 were incubated with E. faecalis for a period of 6 weeks and the topography and ultrastructure of the biofilm were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), light microscopy, and laser confocal scanning microscopy. The sediments formed from the bacterial interaction on the dentine (in group 1) were also examined by SEM and FTIR. These experiments highlighted different stages in the interaction of E. faecalis with root canal dentine. Further, a bacterial-induced apatite reprecipitation on mature biofilm was also observed. This ability of E. faecalis to form such calcified biofilm on root canal dentine may be a factor that contributes to their persistence after endodontic treatment. 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Marker grain method is commonly used by palynologists to quantify absolute pollen concentration in sediments. DuPont NEM plastic microbeads and Lycopodium spore tablets are two of the most commonly used marker grains. The DuPont NEM series has an obvious advantage over Lycopodium tablets because Lycopodium is not guaranteed `exotic' in many ecosystems (especially in the past). Moreover, NEM also has high visibility, easily identifiable spherical shape, and availability in different size ranges. However, the production of NEM has been discontinuous since more than a decade, and palynologists of the world are using the precious remainders of their own stock in very small (=suboptimal) quantities. Here we propose a solution. Microspheres of black ceramic can be used as marker grains for a wide range of microfossil analyses (in this paper, however, we mainly discuss the use of the material for pollen analysis because of the expertise of the authors). The ceramic spheres are tolerant to all chemicals commonly used during pollen extraction processes and is extremely resistant to physical stresses. The particles are matt black, spherical, available in a wide range of size clusters, have a density very close to that of fossil pollen grains (1.424~g/cm3 vs. 1.494~g/cm3 in average), and don't change color and density over a long storage in acidic liquids. The behavior of ceramic spheres was closer to the pollen grains than the Lycopodium spores regardless of the pollen concentration and composition in sediments. In combination, these properties make the black ceramic spheres an even better solution for palynologists than DuPont NEM microbeads or Lycopodium spore tablets. The absolute pollen concentrations estimated from ceramic spheres and those estimated from volume method were indistinguishable within errors. On the other hand, when the samples were relatively poor in fossil pollen grains, the concentrations calculated by Lycopodium method tended to be significantly overestimated. The ceramic microbeads are available either as a dry powder in different size ranges, or as a mixture of two size ranges blended in a defined ratio and dispersed in a buoyancy-neutral liquid, ready to be added to sediment samples. Mixing two different size ranges in a known ratio serves to detect any laboratory failures that differentially favor recovery of larger or smaller pollen types.},

  abstract = {In Sigtuna, Sweden, a medieval cemetery, including 227 skeletons, was analysed in 2006. On the outskirts of the churchyard, six skeletons with bone changes indicating systemic inflammatory disease were observed. Two out of three individuals with well-preserved facial bone regions displayed signs of rhinomaxillary remodelling. Four of the afflicted exhibit severe bilateral alterations of the lower legs and phalanges of the feet and concentric atrophy of the metatarsals. In addition, one of the individuals exhibited a kyphosis in the lumbar vertebrae. In a discussion about alternative diagnoses, lepromatous leprosy and tuberculosis were identified as the causes of the destructive lesions in two individuals. Though the skeletal changes of the lower legs and feet in four cases demonstrate a close resemblance to secondary lesions of leprosy, the disease could not be confirmed. The skeletal changes of the last individual were unspecific and the possible causes several, rendering diagnosis difficult. The burial locations imply that the afflicted persons belonged to a lower social stratum. Due to the significantly higher frequency of pathological changes in the cemetery compared to other cemeteries in the town, the individuals could be regarded as fellow sufferers among others with various medical conditions. The bioarchaeological identification of systemic infectious diseases of a group of individuals of this size is unique to north of Scania in Sweden, where only a few cases of leprosy and tuberculosis have previously been diagnosed. The significance of the present study is emphasised by the interconnection between the afflicted, the archaeological context and the knowledge of the medieval society in Sigtuna.

This study investigates all three of Phenice's characteristics in an approach similar to Walker's (Am J Phys Anthropol 136 (2008) 39\textendash 50) study using observations from the cranium and mandible. The ventral arc, the subpubic contour, and the medial aspect of the ischio-pubic ramus were scored on a five-point ordinal scale from a sample of 310 adult, left innominates of known ancestry and sex from the Hamann-Todd Human Osteological Collection and the W.M. Bass Donated Skeletal Collection. Four observers with varying levels of experience blindly scored each trait using new descriptions and illustrations adapted from those originally created by Phenice. The scores were then analyzed with ordinal logistic regression. Using all three traits for sex classification, the mean correct classification rate was 94.5\% cross-validated for experienced observers. Intra- and interobserver error in trait scoring was low for all three traits and agreement levels ranged from moderate to substantial. Tests of the method on an independent validation sample provided a classification accuracy of 86.2\%. This revision of the Phenice (Am J Phys Anthropol 30 (1969) 297\textendash 302) technique is a reliable and valid method of sex estimation from the human innominate that meets the Daubert criteria for court admissibility. 2012.

Based on visual inspection of the ground sections in reflected and transmitted light and microradiographic findings, small areas were dissected out and processed for electron microscopy. In the tertiary dentin formed in the pulp horns the number of tubules was reduced, while in that on the side walls of the pulp there was often no marked reduction in the number of tubules. Several tubules could be followed from the physiological (primary and secondary) dentin into the tertiary dentin, and a change in the direction of the tubules was often noted. Interglobular dentin was frequently observed, and in some teeth incremental lines with alternating high and low mineral content were seen, indicating that tertiary dentin, like other mineralized tissues, is subject to biological rhythms during formation. When studied in the electron microscope, tubules with varying size and distribution as well as occluded tubules with a high mineral content were seen. The tubules often had an irregular circumference with projections of mineralized tissue protruding into the lumen. Highly mineralized peritubular dentin was rarely observed. The present results show that orthodentin is formed when dentin in primary human teeth is exposed to mild or moderate stimuli.}

A number of studies have addressed different aspects of sampling, DNA extraction and DNA manipulation in order to establish protocols that most efficiently generate reproducible and authentic results. As increasing numbers of researchers from different backgrounds become interested in using ancient DNA technology to address key questions, the need for practical guidelines on how to construct and use an ancient DNA facility arises.

Because these biofilms are easy to study, they have become the paradigm of multispecies biofilms. In this Review we describe the factors involved in the formation of these biofilms, including the initial adherence to the oral tissues and teeth, cooperation between bacterial species in the biofilm, signalling between the bacteria and its role in pathogenesis, and the transfer of DNA between bacteria. In all these aspects distance between cells of different species is integral for oral biofilm growth.},

The bacterial infection surrounding dental implants can lead to bone loss and, in turn, to implant failure. A promising strategy to prevent these common complications is the development of implant surfaces that inhibit biofilm development. A reproducible and easy-to-use biofilm model as a test system for large scale screening of new implant surfaces with putative antibacterial potency is therefore of major importance. In the present study, we developed a highly reproducible in vitro four-species biofilm model consisting of the highly relevant oral bacterial species Streptococcus oralis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella dispar and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The application of live/dead staining, quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and urea-NaCl fluorescence in situ hybridization (urea-NaCl-FISH) revealed that the four-species biofilm community is robust in terms of biovolume, live/dead distribution and individual species distribution over time. The biofilm community is dominated by S. oralis, followed by V. dispar, A. naeslundii and P. gingivalis. The percentage distribution in this model closely reflects the situation in early native plaques and is therefore well suited as an in vitro model test system. Furthermore, despite its nearly native composition, the multispecies model does not depend on nutrient additives, such as native human saliva or serum, and is an inexpensive, easy to handle and highly reproducible alternative to the available model systems. The 96-well plate format enables high content screening for optimized implant surfaces impeding biofilm formation or the testing of multiple antimicrobial treatment strategies to fight multispecies biofilm infections, both exemplary proven in the manuscript.},

In other words, while our research goals and perspectives are rooted in probabilistic thinking and rest on prior knowledge, we often proceed to use statistical hypothesis tests and confidence interval methods unrelated (or tenuously related) to the research questions of interest. We advocate for applying Bayesian analyses to a number of different bioanthropological questions, especially since many of the programming and computational challenges to doing so have been overcome in the past two decades. To facilitate such applications, this article explains Bayesian principles and concepts, and provides concrete examples of Bayesian computer simulations and statistics that address questions relevant to biological anthropology, focusing particularly on bioarchaeology and forensic anthropology. It also simultaneously reviews the use of Bayesian methods and inference within the discipline to date. This article is intended to act as primer to Bayesian methods and inference in biological anthropology, explaining the relationships of various methods to likelihoods or probabilities and to classical statistical models. Our contention is not that traditional frequentist statistics should be rejected outright, but that there are many situations where biological anthropology is better served by taking a Bayesian approach. To this end it is hoped that the examples provided in this article will assist researchers in choosing from among the broad array of statistical methods currently available.

We show here that in cases where age is estimated rather than known, the traditional method of assigning individuals to age classes will produce biased estimates of age structure. We demonstrate the effect of this bias both mathematically and by computer simulation, and show how a more appropriate method from the fisheries literature (the ``iterated age length key'') can be used to estimate age structure. Because it is often the case that ages are also estimated for extant groups, we suggest that our results are relevant to the general field of anthropological demography, and that it is time for us to improve the statistical basis for age structure estimation. We further suggest that the oft noted paucity of older individuals in skeletal collections is a simple result of the use of inappropriate methods of age estimation, and that this problem can be rectified in the future by using maximum likelihood estimates of life table or hazard functions incorporating the uncertainty of age estimates. \textcopyright{} 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}

Two of the more disparate subdisciplines of our discipline, paleoanthropology and forensic anthropology, routinely make use of various estimation methods on a case-by-case basis. We discuss the rationales for making estimations on isolated cases, taking stature estimation from femoral and humerus lengths as an example. We show that the entirety of our discussion can be placed within the context of calibration problems, where a large calibration sample is used to estimate an unobservable quantity for a single skeleton. Taking a calibration approach to the problem highlights the essentially Bayesian versus maximum likelihood nature of the question of stature estimation. On the basis of both theoretical arguments and practical examples, we show that inverse calibration (regression of stature on bone length) is generally preferred when the stature distribution for a reference sample forms a reasonable prior, while classical calibration (regression of bone length on stature followed by solving for stature) is preferred when there is reason to suspect that the estimated stature will be an extrapolation beyond the useful limits of the reference sample statures. The choice between these two approaches amounts to the decision to use either a Bayesian or a maximum likelihood method.

Logistic and probit regression models are commonly used statistical tools for the analysis of ordinal categorical data. These models provide unbiased estimates of the posterior probabilities of sex conditional on observed indicators, but they do so only under certain conditions. We suggest a more general method for sexing using a multivariate cumulative probit model and examine both single indicator and multivariate indicator models on a sample of 138 crania from a Late Mississippian site in middle Tennessee. The crania were scored for five common sex indicators: superciliary arch form, chin form, size of mastoid process, shape of the supraorbital margin, and nuchal cresting. Independent assessment of sex for each individual is based on pubic indicators. The traditional logistic regressions are cumbersome because of limitations imposed by missing data. The logistic regression correctly classified 66/74 males and 46/64 females, with an overall correct classification of 81\%. The cumulative probit model classified 64/74 males correctly and 51/64 females correctly for an overall correct classification rate of 83\%. Finally, we apply parameters estimated from the logit and probit models to find posterior probabilities of sex assignment for 296 additional crania for which pubic indicators were absent or ambiguous.

  abstract = {HIV-1 sequences were analyzed to estimate the timing of the ancestral sequence of the main group of HIV-1, the strains responsible for the AIDS pandemic. Using parallel supercomputers and assuming a constant rate of evolution, we applied maximum-likelihood phylogenetic methods to unprecedented amounts of data for this calculation. We validated our approach by correctly estimating the timing of two historically documented points. Using a comprehensive full-length envelope sequence alignment, we estimated the date of the last common ancestor of the main group of HIV-1 to be 1931 (1915\textendash 41). Analysis of a gag gene alignment, subregions of envelope including additional sequences, and a method that relaxed the assumption of a strict molecular clock also supported these results.}

Taking into consideration the population aspect of sexual dimorphism of the skeleton, the present study aimed to create a sex identification technique using osteometric standards, derived from a contemporary Cretan population. A total of 168 left humeri were measured according to standard osteometric techniques. The differences between the means in males and females were significant (p{$\quad<\quad$}0.0005). About 92.3\% of cases were correctly classified when all measurements were applied jointly. Stepwise procedure produced an accuracy rate of 92.9\%. The most effective single dimension was vertical head diameter (89.9\%). The current study provides standards for a population that has not been represented so far in the existing databases. It demonstrates that the humerus is an effective bone for the estimation of sex because even in a fragmentary state it can give high classification accuracy.}

  abstract = {Previous studies have shown that with advancing age the size of the dental pulp cavity is reduced as a result of secondary dentine deposit, so that measurements of this reduction can be used as an indicator of age. The aim of the present study was to find a method which could be used to estimate the chronological age of an adult from measurements of the size of the pulp on full mouth dental radiographs. The material consisted of periapical radiographs from 100 dental patients who had attended the clinics of the Dental Faculty in Oslo. The radiographs of six types of teeth from each jaw were measured: maxillary central and lateral incisors and second premolars, and mandibular lateral incisors, canines and first premolars. To compensate for differences in magnification and angulation on the radiographs, the following ratios were calculated: pulp/root length, pulp/tooth length, tooth/root length and pulp/root width at three different levels. Statistical analyses showed that Pearson's correlation coefficient between age and the different ratios for each type of tooth was significant, except for the ratio between tooth and root length, which was, therefore, excluded from further analysis. Principal component analyses were performed on all ratios, followed by regression analyses with age as dependent variable and the principal components as independent variables. The principal component analyses showed that only the two first of them had significant influence on age, and a good and easily calculated approximation to the first component was found to be the mean of all the ratios. A good approximation to the second principal component was found to be the difference between the mean of two width ratios and the mean of two length ratios, and these approximations of the first and second principal components were chosen as predictors in regression analyses with age as the dependent variable. The coefficient of determination (r2) for the estimation was strongest when the ratios of the six teeth were included (r2 = 0.76) and weakest when measurements from the mandibular canines alone were included (r2 = 0.56). Measurement on dental radiographs may be a non-invasive technique for estimating the age of adults, both living and dead, in forensic work and in archaeological studies, but the method ought to be tested on an independent sample.},

  abstract = {Dental enamel is the hardest and most mineralized tissue in extinct and extant vertebrate species and provides maximum durability that allows teeth to function as weapons and/or tools as well as for food processing. Enamel development and mineralization is an intricate process tightly regulated by cells of the enamel organ called ameloblasts. These heavily polarized cells form a monolayer around the developing enamel tissue and move as a single forming front in specified directions as they lay down a proteinaceous matrix that serves as a template for crystal growth. Ameloblasts maintain intercellular connections creating a semi-permeable barrier that at one end (basal/proximal) receives nutrients and ions from blood vessels, and at the opposite end (secretory/apical/distal) forms extracellular crystals within specified pH conditions. In this unique environment, ameloblasts orchestrate crystal growth via multiple cellular activities including modulating the transport of minerals and ions, pH regulation, proteolysis, and endocytosis. In many vertebrates, the bulk of the enamel tissue volume is first formed and subsequently mineralized by these same cells as they retransform their morphology and function. Cell death by apoptosis and regression are the fates of many ameloblasts following enamel maturation, and what cells remain of the enamel organ are shed during tooth eruption, or are incorporated into the tooth's epithelial attachment to the oral gingiva. In this review, we examine key aspects of dental enamel formation, from its developmental genesis to the ever-increasing wealth of data on the mechanisms mediating ionic transport, as well as the clinical outcomes resulting from abnormal ameloblast function.},

  abstract = {Whitlockite (in fact magnesium whitlockite) is a calcium orthophosphate crystal in which, in biological conditions, magnesium is partly substituted for calcium. Identified in X-ray or electron diffraction patterns, it occurs in physiological or pathological conditions at extra or intratissular sites, mainly in tissues of non-epithelial origin. In a range of pathological calcifications investigated by X-ray diffraction, we noted that whitlockite appeared to be frequently associated with apatite, particularly in "dystrophic calcifications" of tuberculous origin. These personal observations could be correlated with documented data in oral pathology (dental calculus, salivary stones, and dental caries). Whitlockite deposits have also been reported in non-infectious conditions, such as in aortic media, cartilage, and bone tissue. Whereas the formation of both apatite and magnesium whitlockite appears to be caused by the binding of their constituting ions with proteolipids, magnesium inhibits apatite originating from amorphous calcium phosphate to the benefit of whitlockite formation. Possibly, the development of magnesium whitlockite may provide an interesting marker for magnesium metabolism. Further studies linking histology to crystallography might relate the crystal to issues, such as tuberculous calcifications or diseases of bone tissue, and might be useful for potential diagnostic orientation.},

Biological weathering mainly causes residue decay. In unstable environments rich in microbes and micro-organisms, residues decay quickly. From an archaeological perspective this means that sites that are stable, desiccated, waterlogged, extremely acidic or alkaline and extremely cold or hot sites. Different residue types have different preservation optima and this may lead to a preservation and perhaps interpretation bias. The preliminary predictive models presented in this paper could aid in the considered selection of sites and samples.},

The Chinchorro occupied the river mouth of the Azapa valley, subsisting almost exclusively on a maritime economy. The Maitas Chiribaya, descendants of migrant highlanders, had a rather well-developed agricultural subsistence base. The Chinchorro demonstrated extreme attrition rates and a correspondingly high frequency of periapical abscesses. They were essentially caries-free and enjoyed a moderate antemortem tooth loss frequency. The Maitas Chiribaya suffered light attrition, a high caries frequency, especially at the cementoenamel junction of crown and root, and a remarkably high antemortem tooth loss frequency.

After extensively scanning the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, we identified the V5 hypervariable region as a short region providing reliable identification of bacterial sequences available in public databases such as the Human Oral Microbiome Database. We amplified samples from the oral cavity of three healthy individuals using primers covering an \textasciitilde 82-base segment of the V5 loop, and sequenced using the Illumina technology in a single orientation. We identified 135 genera or higher taxonomic ranks from the resulting 1,373,824 sequences. While the abundances of the most common phyla (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria and TM7) are largely comparable to previous studies, Bacteroidetes were less present. Potential sources for this difference include classification bias in this region of the 16S rRNA gene, human sample variation, sample preparation and primer bias. Using an Illumina sequencing approach, we achieved a much greater depth of coverage than previous oral microbiota studies, allowing us to identify several taxa not yet discovered in these types of samples, and to assess that at least 30,000 additional reads would be required to identify only one additional phylotype. The evolution of high-throughput sequencing technologies, and their subsequent improvements in read length enable the utilization of different platforms for studying communities of complex flora. Access to large amounts of data is already leading to a better representation of sample diversity at a reasonable cost.},

However, biofilms in nature mostly comprise multiple species, where interspecies interactions can shape the development, structure and function of these communities differently from biofilm populations. Hence, a reproducible mixed-species biofilm comprising Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas protegens and Klebsiella pneumoniae was adapted to study how interspecies interactions affect biofilm development, structure and stress responses. Each species was fluorescently tagged to determine its abundance and spatial localization within the biofilm. The mixed-species biofilm exhibited distinct structures that were not observed in comparable single-species biofilms. In addition, development of the mixed-species biofilm was delayed 1\textendash 2 days compared with the single-species biofilms. Composition and spatial organization of the mixed-species biofilm also changed along the flow cell channel, where nutrient conditions and growth rate of each species could have a part in community assembly. Intriguingly, the mixed-species biofilm was more resistant to the antimicrobials sodium dodecyl sulfate and tobramycin than the single-species biofilms. Crucially, such community level resilience was found to be a protection offered by the resistant species to the whole community rather than selection for the resistant species. In contrast, community-level resilience was not observed for mixed-species planktonic cultures. These findings suggest that community-level interactions, such as sharing of public goods, are unique to the structured biofilm community, where the members are closely associated with each other.},

There are few published OF stability data, and of those available, all employed fortified synthetic OF solutions or elution buffers; none included authentic OF following controlled cannabis smoking. METHODS: An expectorated OF pool and a pool of OF collected with Quantisal\texttrademark{} devices were prepared for each of 10 participants. {$\Delta$}9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC (THCCOOH), cannabidiol (CBD), and cannabinol (CBN) stability in each of 10 authentic expectorated and Quantisal-collected OF pools were determined after storage at 4 \textdegree C for 1 and 4 weeks and at -20 \textdegree C for 4 and 24 weeks. Results within {$\pm$}20\% of baseline concentrations analyzed within 24 h of collection were considered stable. RESULTS: All Quantisal OF cannabinoid concentrations were stable for 1 week at 4 \textdegree C. After 4 weeks at 4 \textdegree C, as well as 4 and 24 weeks at -20 \textdegree C, THC was stable in 90\%, 80\%, and 80\% and THCCOOH in 89\%, 40\%, and 50\% of Quantisal samples, respectively. Cannabinoids in expectorated OF were less stable than in Quantisal samples when refrigerated or frozen. After 4 weeks at 4 and -20 \textdegree C, CBD and CBN were stable in 33\%\textendash 100\% of Quantisal and expectorated samples; by 24 weeks at -20 \textdegree C, CBD and CBN were stable in {$\leq$}44\%. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabinoid OF stability varied by analyte, collection method, and storage duration and temperature, and across participants. OF collection with a device containing an elution/stabilization buffer, sample storage at 4 \textdegree C, and analysis within 4 weeks is preferred to maximize result accuracy.}

An OF THCCOOH/THC ratio {$\leq$}4 ng/{$\mu$}g or presence of CBD or CBN may indicate more recent smoking.THC, THCCOOH, CBD, and CBN quantification in confirmatory OF cannabinoid testing is recommended.

  abstract = {Biomaterials, once inserted in the oral cavity, become immediately covered by a layer of adsorbed proteins that consists mostly of salivary proteins but also of plasma proteins if the biomaterial is placed close to the gingival margin or if it becomes implanted into tissue and bone. It is often this protein layer, rather than the pristine biomaterial surface, that is subsequently encountered by colonizing bacteria or attaching tissue cells. Thus, to study this important initial protein adsorption from human saliva and serum and how it might be influenced through chemical modification of the biomaterial surface, we have measured the amount of protein adsorbed and analyzed the composition of the adsorbed protein layer using gel electrophoresis and western blotting. Here, we have developed an in vitro model system based on silica surfaces, chemically modified with 7 silane-based self-assembled monolayers that span a broad range of physicochemical properties, from hydrophilic to hydrophobic surfaces (water contact angles from 15\textdegree{} to 115\textdegree ), low to high surface free energy (12 to 57 mN/m), and negative to positive surface charge (zeta potentials from \textendash 120 to +40 mV at physiologic pH). We found that the chemical surface functionalities exerted a substantial effect on the total amounts of proteins adsorbed; however, no linear correlation of the adsorbed amounts with the physicochemical surface parameters was observed. Only the adsorption behavior of a few singular protein components, from which physicochemical data are available, seems to follow physicochemical expectations. Examples are albumin in serum and lysozyme in saliva; in both, adsorption was favored on countercharged surfaces. We conclude from these findings that in complex biofluids such as saliva and serum, adsorption behavior is dominated by the overall protein-binding capacity of the surface rather than by specific physicochemical interactions of single protein entities with the surface.},

However, among the carbohydrates, sucrose is considered the most cariogenic, because, in addition to being fermented by oral bacteria, it is a substrate for the synthesis of extracellular (EPS) and intracellular (IPS) polysaccharides. Therefore, while the low pH environment triggers the shift of the resident plaque microflora to a more cariogenic one, EPS promote changes in the composition of the biofilms' matrix. Furthermore, it has recently been shown that the biofilm formed in the presence of sucrose presents low concentrations of Ca, Pi, and F, which are critical ions involved in de- and remineralization of enamel and dentin in the oral environment. Thus, the aim of this review is to explore the broad role of sucrose in the cariogenicity of biofilms, and to present a new insight into its influence on the pathogenesis of dental caries.},

While most researchers use either hydrochloric acid (HCl) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to demineralise samples and release embedded microremains, protocols vary significantly in regard to chemical concentration and duration. Furthermore, there are conflicting reports concerning the suitability of these chemicals for archaeological starch analyses, particularly when granules are modified (damaged) such as from food processing or enzymatic digestion. This study tests 0.5~M HCl and 0.5~M EDTA on modified modern wheat, chickpea and potato starch with direct observation of individual starch granules over 168~h, the maximum duration reported so far for full decalcification of archaeological calculus samples. While there were no observable changes to gross morphological characteristics of any granules, metric analysis indicates slight changes to average granule size in milled potato and wheat starch in all solutions. Furthermore, interactions between the chemical reagent and ions released from the calculus matrix have the potential to result in the diminished recovery of archaeological starch from HCl extractions. We recommend that of these two chemical decalcification options, EDTA is more suitable for processing archaeological dental calculus for starch microremains as it chelates ions released during decalcification of the calculus matrix that might otherwise adversely affect archaeological starch granules.},

Only in the middle of this century did it become clear that it was acquired after tooth eruption. Initially, the small amounts of material that could be obtained have virtually limited the investigation of pellicle proteins to amino acid analysis. Nevertheless, this technique revealed that the pellicle is mainly proteinaceous and is formed by selective adsorption of salivary proteins on tooth enamel. Later, immunologic techniques allowed for the identification of many salivary and fewer non-salivary proteins as constituents of pellicle. However, to this date, isolation and direct biochemical characterization of in vivo pellicle protein have not been possible, because only a few micrograms can be obtained from a single donor. Therefore, the composition and structure of the acquired enamel pellicle are still essentially unknown. Information on the functions of pellicle has been obtained mainly from in vitro experiments carried out with saliva-coated hydroxyapatite and enamel discs. It was found that pellicle protects enamel by reducing demineralization upon acid challenge. Improved pellicle harvesting procedures and analysis by state-of-the-art proteomics with mass spectroscopy approaches promise to make major inroads into the characterization of enamel pellicle.},

This study examines how well starch granules and phytoliths in dental calculus from a living population (the Twe) with a well-documented diet capture the range and intensity of plant consumption. We find that plant microremains are a poor predictor of plant consumption on an individual level, but may provide a good signal of plant consumption across a population, as well as evidence for plant processing in the mouth. This is the first study to test how well plant microremains in dental calculus reflect plant consumption in a population with a known diet.

  abstract = {Background~         A surgical procedure is a complex behavior that can be constructed from foundation or component behaviors. Both the component and the composite behaviors built from them are much more likely to recur if it they are reinforced (operant learning). Behaviors in humans have been successfully reinforced using the acoustic stimulus from a mechanical clicker, where the clicker serves as a conditioned reinforcer that communicates in a way that is language- and judgment-free; however, to our knowledge, the use of operant-learning principles has not been formally evaluated for acquisition of surgical skills.         Questions/purposes~         Two surgical tasks were taught and compared using two teaching strategies: (1) an operant learning methodology using a conditioned, acoustic reinforcer (a clicker) for positive reinforcement; and (2) a more classical approach using demonstration alone. Our goal was to determine whether a group that is taught a surgical skill using an operant learning procedure would more precisely perform that skill than a group that is taught by demonstration alone.         Methods~         Two specific behaviors, ``tying the locking, sliding knot'' and ``making a low-angle drill hole,'' were taught to the 2014 Postgraduate Year (PGY)-1 class and first- and second-year medical students, using an operant learning procedure incorporating precise scripts along with acoustic feedback. The control groups, composed of PGY-1 and -2 nonorthopaedic surgical residents and first- and second-year medical students, were taught using demonstration alone. The precision and speed of each behavior was recorded for each individual by a single experienced surgeon, skilled in operant learning. The groups were then compared.         Results~         The operant learning group achieved better precision tying the locking, sliding knot than did the control group. Twelve of the 12 test group learners tied the knot and precisely performed all six component steps, whereas only four of the 12 control group learners tied the knot and correctly performed all six component steps (the test group median was 10 [range, 10-10], the control group median was 0 [range, 0-10], p = 0.004). However, the median ``time to tie the first knot'' for the test group was longer than for the control group (test group median 271 seconds [range, 184-626 seconds], control group median 163 seconds [range 93-900 seconds], p = 0.017), whereas the ``time to tie 10 of the locking, sliding knots'' was the same for both groups (test group mean 95 seconds {$\pm$} SD = 15 [range, 67-120 seconds], control group mean 95 seconds {$\pm$} SD = 28 [range, 62-139 seconds], p = 0.996).         For the low-angle drill hole test, the test group more consistently achieved the ideal six-step behavior for precisely drilling the low-angle hole compared with the control group (p = 0.006 for the median number of technique success comparison with an odds ratio [at the 95\% confidence interval] of 82.3 [29.1-232.8]). The mean time to drill 10 low-angle holes was not different between the test group (mean 193 seconds {$\pm$} SD = 26 [range, 153-222 seconds]) and the control group (mean 146 seconds {$\pm$} SD = 63 [range, 114-294 seconds]) (p = 0.084).         Conclusions~         Operant learning occurs as the behavior is constructed and is highly reinforced with the result measured, not in the time saved, but in the ultimate outcome of an accurately built complex behavior.

The attrition condition of the molar crown was analyzed, and a new graduation standard was established. Six linear equations for age estimation were obtained by means of regression analysis. The ASA method gave an estimated age at death from only one molar, either M1 or M2, on either maxilla or mandible. The maximum error of these equations was 4.53 years. The results show that the ASA method can or does reflect the attrition condition of the whole occlusal surface more objectively than some methods using dental wear because the wear degree is estimated by averaging the wear stages of all the cusps rather than of only one or partial cusps.},

The four cemetery populations considered represent two distinct biological and cultural groups separated by an apparent 700-year hiatus: the late Mesolithic-early Neolithic Kitoi culture (6800\textendash 4900 BC) and the middle Neolithic-early Bronze Age Serovo\textendash Glaskovo cultural complex (4200\textendash 1000 BC). Research focuses on the frequency and severity of seven dental health indicators: enamel hypoplasia, caries, alveolar defects, periodontitis, antemortem tooth loss, dental calculus, and dental attrition. Together, these seven indicators provide a basis not only for better understanding mid-Holocene lifeways in the Cis-Baikal but also for independently assessing the relative effectiveness of the different adaptive strategies employed by pre- and posthiatus peoples. Results reveal some discrepancies between the Kitoi and Serovo\textendash Glaskovo, specifically in their relative vulnerability to physiological stress, providing evidence to support previous interpretations of their distinct adaptive regimes (namely the narrower resource base and decreased mobility of the former). Results also suggest that some of the differences observed among the four sites may reflect geographical or environmental factors rather than simply cultural ones. However, despite these distinctions, the overriding trend appears to be one of general continuity, social equality, and good health among all mid-Holocene occupants of the Cis-Baikal, pre- and posthiatus alike.

  abstract = {The aetiology of dental calculus formation is not fully understood, but it is known that a number of factors play a role. Generally, anthropologists have overlooked the role of other causative factors in the formation of dental calculus, attributing it almost exclusively to diet, particularly protein consumption. Anthropologists have also oversimplified the role of diet in the formation of dental calculus. This may be due to a general paucity on research on dietary effects on calculus formation, as well as a lack of integration between anthropological and non-anthropological data.

  abstract = {China is a major centre for rice domestication, where starch grain analysis has been widely applied to archaeological grinding tools to gain information about plant use by ancient Chinese societies. However, few rice starch grains have been identified to date. To understand this apparent scarcity of starch grains from rice, dry- and wet-grinding experiments with stone tools were carried out on four types of cereals: rice (Oryza sativa L.), foxtail millet (Setaria italica), Job's tears (Coix lacryma-jobi L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). The results reveal that dry-grinding produces significant damage to starches to the point where they may be undetected in archaeological samples, while wet-grinding causes only slight morphological changes to the starch grains. Moreover, rice starch grains have the most substantial alterations from dry-grinding, possibly impeding their identification. These findings provide a possible means to explain the relative scarcity of rice starch grains recovered from archaeological grinding tools, which it is suggested was caused by the use of the dry-grinding technique. Therefore, it is suggested that rice starch grains have been likely underrepresented in the archaeological record, and previous interpretations of starch analyses need to be reconsidered.},

However, the lack of standardised methods for saliva collection has led to the slow uptake of saliva in microbiome research. The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the potential effects on salivary microbiome profiles using different methods of saliva collection, storage and gDNA extraction. Three types of saliva fractions were collected from healthy individuals with or without the gDNA stabilising buffer. Subsequently, three types of gDNA extraction methods were evaluated to determine the gDNA extraction efficiencies from saliva samples. The purity of total bacterial gDNA was evaluated using the ratio of human {$\beta$}-globin to bacterial 16S rRNA PCR while 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was carried out to identify the bacterial profiles present in these samples. The quantity and quality of extracted gDNA were similar among all three gDNA extraction methods and there were no statistically significant differences in the bacterial profiles among different saliva fractions at the genus-level of taxonomic classification. In conclusion, saliva sampling, processing and gDNA preparation do not have major influence on microbiome profiles.},

We introduce a methodology called Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes with Bias Correction (ANCOM-BC), which estimates the unknown sampling fractions and corrects the bias induced by their differences among samples. The absolute abundance data are modeled using a linear regression framework. This formulation makes a fundamental advancement in the field because, unlike the existing methods, it (a) provides statistically valid test with appropriate p-values, (b) provides confidence intervals for differential abundance of each taxon, (c) controls the False Discovery Rate (FDR), (d) maintains adequate power, and (e) is computationally simple to implement.},

The degradation of neutral THC seems to occur somewhat slower. When cannabinoids were stored in extracted form at room temperature the degradation rate of acidic THC increased significantly relative to resin material with concentration halve-lives of 35 and 91 days in daylight and darkness, respectively.

Three separate experimental series were performed including: 1) rye and wheat products, 2) wheat products processed under both mild and severe conditions, and 3) wheat products with and without added sucrose. The pH drop in dental plaque was studied after a mouthrinse in groups of 10 subjects. Solutions of glucose or sucrose were used as references. No differences were found between boiled rye and boiled wheat, nor between rye bread and wheat bread. Severely popped wheat resulted in the greatest pH drop, followed, in order, by drum-dried and extrusion-cooked products. Mildly steam-flaked and mildly dry-autoclaved products induced comparable small pH falls. Sucrose-sweetened wheat products resulted in lower plaque pH values compared to unsweetened products. This effect was most pronounced with a mildly processed sample. In all three series, the glucose and sucrose reference solutions showed the greatest pH drop. In conclusion, all processing methods increased the fermentability of starch in human dental plaque in vivo. Thus, the more severe the processing conditions the more prominent the pH falls. The pH drop in plaque in vivo correlated (r = 0.96 in Series 1 and r = 0.92 in Series 2) with the rate of starch hydrolysis with alpha-amylase in vitro.},

  abstract = {The oral microbiome, the complex ecosystem of microbes inhabiting the human mouth, harbors several thousands of bacterial types. The proliferation of pathogenic bacteria within the mouth gives rise to periodontitis, an inflammatory disease known to also constitute a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. While much is known about individual species associated with pathogenesis, the system-level mechanisms underlying the transition from health to disease are still poorly understood. Through the sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and of whole community DNA we provide a glimpse at the global genetic, metabolic, and ecological changes associated with periodontitis in 15 subgingival plaque samples, four from each of two periodontitis patients, and the remaining samples from three healthy individuals. We also demonstrate the power of whole-metagenome sequencing approaches in characterizing the genomes of key players in the oral microbiome, including an unculturable TM7 organism. We reveal the disease microbiome to be enriched in virulence factors, and adapted to a parasitic lifestyle that takes advantage of the disrupted host homeostasis. Furthermore, diseased samples share a common structure that was not found in completely healthy samples, suggesting that the disease state may occupy a narrow region within the space of possible configurations of the oral microbiome. Our pilot study demonstrates the power of high-throughput sequencing as a tool for understanding the role of the oral microbiome in periodontal disease. Despite a modest level of sequencing (,2 lanes Illumina 76 bp PE) and high human DNA contamination (up to ,90\%) we were able to partially reconstruct several oral microbes and to preliminarily characterize some systems-level differences between the healthy and diseased oral microbiomes.},

Methods and analysis In this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a total of 120 participants during periodontal maintenance phase will be enrolled. After supragingival scaling, they will be randomly assigned into three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio: the Pudilan Keyanning antibacterial mouthwash group, a chlorhexidine acetate mouthwash (0.12\%) group or a placebo group with mouthwash containing the same components as the Pudilan Keyanning mouthwash except for Pudilan active ingredients.

Therefore, it is necessary for oral healthcare providers to understand the effects of cannabis use on oral health. This review briefly summarizes the components of cannabis, biologic activities on tissues, and mechanisms of action in human cells and tissues. Oral tissue expression of cannabinoid receptors and the potential association of cannabis to oral diseases are also examined. The goals of this review are to (1) elaborate the basic biology and physiology of cannabis in human oral tissues, and (2) provide a better understanding the effects of its use and abuse on oral health. Due to insufficient information, more well-designed studies should be conducted. It is urgent to include cannabis usage into dental patient health records.},

This study aimed at constructing a noninvasive auxiliary diagnostic model for diabetes based on differences in the salivary microbial community. Design Salivary microbiota from 24 treatment-naive type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and 21 healthy populations were detected through 16S rRNA gene sequencing, targeting the V3/V4 region using the MiSeq platform. Salivary microbiome diversity and composition were analyzed so as to establish a diagnostic model for type 2 diabetes. Results Salivary microbiome for treatment-naive type 2 diabetes mellitus patients was imbalanced with certain taxa, including Slackia, Mitsuokella, Abiotrophia, and Parascardovia that being significantly dominant, while the abundance of Moraxella was high in healthy controls. Diabetic patients exhibited varying levels of Prevotella nanceiensis and Prevotella melaninogenica which were negatively correlated with glycosylated hemoglobin and fasting blood glucose levels, as well as fasting blood glucose levels, respectively. Based on differences in salivary microbiome composition between diabetic and healthy groups, we developed a diagnostic model that can be used for the auxiliary diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus with an accuracy of 80 \%. Conclusions These findings elucidate on the differences in salivary microbiome compositions between type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic populations, and the diagnostic model provides a promising approach for the noninvasive auxiliary diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.},

Researchers use computational methods to mine the large quantity of sequencing data to detect characteristic patterns of DNA damage, and to evaluate the authenticity of the results. We argue that unless computational methods can confidently separate authentic ancient DNA sequences from contaminating DNA that displays damage patterns under independent decay processes, prevention and control of DNA contamination should remain a central and critical aspect of ancient human DNA studies. Ideally, DNA contamination can be prevented early on by following minimal guidelines during excavation, sample collection and/or subsequent handling. Contaminating DNA should also be monitored or minimised in the ancient DNA laboratory using specialised facilities and strict experimental procedures. In this paper, we update recommendations to control for DNA contamination from the field to the laboratory, in an attempt to facilitate communication between field archaeologists, anthropologists and ancient DNA researchers. We also provide updated criteria of ancient DNA authenticity for HTS-based studies. We are confident that the procedures outlined here will increase the retrieval of higher proportions of authentic genetic information from valuable archaeological human remains in the future.},

Whereas, the role of the mineral component of the tooth enamel in providing this resistance to acid erosion has been studied extensively, the influence of proteins that are also present within the structure is not well understood. In this paper, we report for the first time the use of double-layer force spectroscopy to directly measure electrostatic forces on as received and hydrazine-treated (deproteinated) enamel surfaces in solutions with different pH to determine how the enamel proteins influence acid erosion surface potential and surface charge of human dental enamel. The deproteination of the treated samples was confirmed by the loss of the amide bands (\textasciitilde 1,300\textendash 1,700~cm-1) in the FTIR spectrum of the sample. The force characteristics observed were found to agree with the theory of electrical double layer interaction under the assumption of constant potential and allowed the surface charge per unit area to be determined for the two enamel surfaces. The values and, importantly, the sign of these adsorbed surface charges indicates that the protein content of dental enamel contributes significantly to the electrostatic double layer formation near the tooth surface and in doing so can buffer the apatite crystals against acid attack. Moreover, the electrostatic interactions within this layer are a driving factor for the mineral transfer from the tooth surface and the initial salivary pellicle formation.},

  abstract = {The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a widespread neuromodulatory system that plays important roles in central nervous system (CNS) development, synaptic plasticity, and the response to endogenous and environmental insults. The ECS is comprised of cannabinoid receptors, endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids), and the enzymes responsible for the synthesis and degradation of the endocannabinoids. The most abundant cannabinoid receptor is the CB1 cannabinoid receptors, however CB2 cannabinoid receptors, transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, and peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR's) are also engaged by some cannabinoids. Exogenous cannabinoids, such as tetrahydrocannabinol, produce their biological effects through their interactions with cannabinoid receptors. 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) and arachidonoyl ethanolamide (anandamide) are the best-studied endogenous cannabinoids. Despite similarities in chemical structure, 2-AG and anandamide are synthesized and degraded by distinct enzymatic pathways, which impart fundamentally different physiological and pathophysiological roles to these two endocannabinoids. Because of the pervasive social use of cannabis and the involvement of endocannabinoids in a multitude of biological processes, much has been learned about the physiological and pathophysiological roles of the ECS. This review will provide an introduction to the ECS with an emphasis on its role in synaptic plasticity and how the ECS is perturbed in schizophrenia.}

The aims of this paper are threefold: to generate population-specific formulae for sex estimation based on permanent canine metrics, to evaluate the dental sexual dimorphism, and to develop a Bayesian approach in a sample of 115 individuals from the documented human sample housed in the University of Coimbra (Portugal). Discriminant functions and logistic regression equations were developed, and posterior probabilities were calculated. Formulae offered high percentages of correct sex assignation (77.42\textendash 86.54\% for the discriminant functions and 81.63\textendash 85.18\% for the logistic regression), whereas posterior probabilities ranged between 0.71 and 0.85. The procedures were then applied in an archaeological sample of 32 individuals from the Roman (I-III century AC) cemetery of Ossonoba Romana (Faro, Portugal) in order to test the relevance of their use in this geographical-related sample. The results of correct estimation are higher than 75\% for three formulae and four combinations of variables in the Bayesian approach. Although phenotypic variation may be a factor influencing the sex estimations, canine odontometrics are powerful tools when previously tested and can increase the amount of data obtained for paleodemographic and forensic purposes. In this case, some of the methods developed for the modern sample can be used in archaeological samples and in spatial and temporal-related skeletal collections.},

Terms related to definition, diagnosis, risk assessment, and monitoring of dental caries were included. The Delphi process was used to establish terms to be considered using the nominal group method favored by consensus. Of 222 terms originally suggested by six cariologists from different countries, a total of 59 terms were reviewed after removing duplicates and unnecessary words. Sixteen experts in cariology took part in the process of reaching consensus about the definitions of the selected caries terms. Decisions were made following thorough ``round table'' discussions of each term and confirmed by secret electronic voting. Full agreement (100\%) was reached on 17 terms, while the definitions of 6 terms were below the agreed 80\% threshold of consensus. The suggested terminology is recommended for use in research, in public health, as well as in clinical practice.}

We found little correlation between the quantity of calculus analysed and total protein identifications, as well as no systematic trends between site location and protein preservation. We identified a wide range of individual variability, which may be associated with the mechanisms of calculus formation and/or post-depositional contamination, in addition to taphonomic factors. Our results suggest dental calculus is indeed a stable, long-term reservoir of proteins as previously reported, but further systematic studies are needed to identify mechanisms associated with protein entrapment and survival in dental calculus.},

Until recently, the vast research potential of dental calculus for archaeological study was not fully appreciated and it was often discarded. It is now recognized that dental calculus entombs and preserves valuable microfossils and biomolecules within its matrix. While microscopic and biomolecular analysis of calculus is destructive, judicious sampling of relatively small quantities of material can provide unique information on ancient health and diet. Additionally, dental calculus is not classified as human tissue, but as an ectopic growth, and in some cases may provide an alternative approach to the destructive analysis of human skeletal remains. We present a case study recovering proteins, DNA, and microscopic debris from Roman Age individuals to demonstrate the important insights into diet, health, and disease that can be obtained from even minute quantities of dental calculus.},

Both groups are rural, high-fertility forager-horticulturalists, with high lifetime physical activity levels. We test whether Tsimane and Shuar bone density patterns are different from each other, and if both groups are characterized by lower osteoporosis risk compared to U.S. references. Methods: Anthropometric and calcaneal bone density data, obtained via quantitative ultrasonometry (QUS), were collected from 678 Tsimane and 235 Shuar (13\textendash 92 years old). Population and sex differences in QUS values (estimated bone mineral density, speed of sound, broadband ultrasound attenuation) by age group were assessed using Mann\textendash Whitney U tests. Age-related change and age at peak QUS value were determined using polynomial regressions. One-way analyses of covariance assessed population-level differences in QUS values by age group adjusting for body mass index. Participants aged 50+ years at elevated osteoporosis risk were identified using a T score {$<$} -1.8; binomial tests assessed risk compared to U.S. references. Results: Shuar males and females {$<$}50 years old have QUS values 3\textendash 36\% higher than Tsimane, with differences evident in adolescence. Among Tsimane and Shuar, 49 and 23\% of participants aged 50+ years old, respectively, are at high risk for osteoporosis, compared to 34\% of Americans; Shuar osteoporosis risk is comparable to Americans, while Tsimane risk is elevated. Conclusions: Disparate patterns in QUS values are documented for Tsimane and Shuar, with pronounced differences early in life. Potential explanations for differences include gene\textendash environment interactions and/or degree of market integration, which influences diet, activity profiles, pathogen exposures, and other lifestyle covariates. As Tsimane osteoporosis risk is greater than in the United States, findings point to alternative risk factors for low bone density that are not readily discernible in industrialized populations.},

Results indicate that weaning had already commenced in the youngest children. Diet became tougher from four years of age, and harder from age six. Variation in microwear texture surfaces was related to historical textual evidence that refers to lifestyle developments for these age groups. Diet did not vary with socio-economic status, which differs to previously reported patterns for adults. We conclude, microwear texture analyses can provide a non-destructive tool for revealing subtle aspects of childhood diet in the past.},

Little is known about the potential links between these aspects of dental development in deciduous teeth of any primate species. This histology study calculates the rate at which roots extend in length for human deciduous maxillary teeth and a small sample of deciduous canines and premolars from P. troglodytes and Pongo pygmaeus. Links are sought between root extension rates and previously published data for deciduous tooth emergence in each of these species. Results reported here provide the first evidence that the roots of human deciduous incisors, canines, and premolars extend in length at an accelerated rate as these teeth emerge. Accelerated extension rates in a deciduous canine from Pan coincided with the age that this tooth type emerged in captive chimpanzees. High extension rates in a canine from Pongo preceded emergence age. Preliminary observations indicate that deciduous canine and premolar roots of Pan and Pongo extend in length rapidly when compared to these tooth types from modern human children. This study provides a starting point from which to investigate new links between the incremental development of deciduous roots and tooth emergence in primates.},

However, it is yet to be proven whether wild plants were exploited despite the cultivation of millet, and whether wheat crops, cattle, and sheep originating from southwestern Asia were adopted into the regional human diet. This study presents stable isotope, starch grain, and phytolith analyses of 24 human teeth from the Lajia site in Qinghai, which is a representative Qijia culture settlement site. The carbon and nitrogen isotope results show that the subjects primarily ate C4 plants and had a high protein diet. Starch grain and phytolith results showed that the inhabitants consumed broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum), foxtail millet (Setaria italica), Triticeae, tubers and roots, along with other Pooideae and Poaceae plants. This data proves that although broomcorn and foxtail millet formed the mainstay of the Qijia diet, it also included a wide range of plants, such as the tribe Triticeae, tubers and roots, which would have been foraged rather than grown. Compared with the other three contemporaneous sites in Northern China, the proportion of millet starches was highest at the Lajia site, while the type and proportion of foraged plants were the lowest. This was probably because of the arid environment in the region, which could not have supported sufficient plant resources for foraging, which in turn might have led to enhanced millet cultivation and/or a greater reliance on hunting. No wheat or barley traces were found in human teeth in Lajia, and the high proportion of nitrogen was possibly related to the consumption of sheep because sheep bones were found in a zooarchaeological study. This study enhances our understanding of the subsistence strategies present in Qijia culture and of prehistoric food globalization, which is of pivotal significance for a deeper understanding of interactions between east and west Asia during the Neolithic and Bronze ages.}

Our findings are supported by theoretical analysis based on a model of parametrically excited vibrations in liquid-filled elastic cylinders using material parameters of the worm's body reported in the literature. The ability to excite nonlinear subharmonic body waves in a living organism could be used to probe, and potentially to control, important biophysical processes such as the propagation of nerve impulses, thereby opening up avenues for addressing biological questions of fundamental impact.},

Here, we present the oropharyngeal microbiota characteristics identified by shotgun metagenomic sequencing analyses of oropharynx swab specimens from 31 COVID-19 patients, 29 influenza B patients, and 28 healthy controls. Our results revealed a distinct oropharyngeal microbiota composition in the COVID-19 patients, characterized by enrichment of opportunistic pathogens such as Veillonella and Megasphaera and depletion of Pseudopropionibacterium, Rothia, and Streptococcus. Based on the relative abundance of the oropharyngeal microbiome, we built a microbial classifier to distinguish COVID-19 patients from flu patients and healthy controls with an AUC of 0.889, in which Veillonella was identified as the most prominent biomarker for COVID-19 group. Several members of the genus Veillonella, especially Veillonella parvula which was highly enriched in the oropharynx of our COVID-19 patients, were also overrepresented in the BALF of COVID-19 patients, indicating that the oral cavity acts as a natural reservoir for pathogens to induce co-infections in the lungs of COVID-19 patients. We also found the increased ratios of Klebsiella sp., Acinetobacter sp., and Serratia sp. were correlated with both disease severity and elevated systemic inflammation markers (neutrophil\textendash lymphocyte ratio, NLR), suggesting that these oropharynx microbiota alterations may impact COVID-19 severity by influencing the inflammatory response. Moreover, the oropharyngeal microbiome of COVID-19 patients exhibited a significant enrichment in amino acid metabolism and xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism. In addition, all 26 drug classes of antimicrobial resistance genes were detected in the COVID-19 group, and were significantly enriched in critical cases. In conclusion, we found that oropharyngeal microbiota alterations and functional differences were associated with COVID-19 severity.},

Ancient residues extracted from stone tools frequently exhibit damage from processing methods, and modern experiments can replicate these morphological changes so that they can be better understood. Here, experiments have been undertaken to dehusk and grind grass grain using stone artifacts. To replicate ancient activities in northern China, we used modern stone tools to dehusk and grind twelve cultivars of foxtail millet (Setaria italica), two cultivars of broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum) and three varieties of green bristlegrass (Setaira viridis). The residues from both used and unused facets of the stone tools were then extracted, and the starch grains studied for morphological features and changes from the native states. The results show that (1) Dehusking did not significantly change the size and morphology of millet starch grains; (2) After grinding, the size of millet starch grains increases up to 1.2 times larger than native grains, and a quarter of the ground millet starch grains bore surface damage and also exhibited distortion of the extinction cross. This indicator will be of significance in improving the application of starch grains to research in the functional inference of grinding stone tools, but we are unable to yet distinguish dehusked forms from native.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The digestion of dietary starch in humans is initiated by salivary {$\alpha$}-amylase, an endo-enzyme that hydrolyzes starch into maltose, maltotriose and larger oligosaccharides. Salivary amylase accounts for 40 to 50\% of protein in human saliva and rapidly alters the physical properties of starch. Importantly, the quantity and enzymatic activity of salivary amylase show significant individual variation. However, linking variation in salivary amylase levels with the oral perception of starch has proven difficult. Furthermore, the relationship between copy number variations (CNVs) in the AMY1 gene, which influence salivary amylase levels, and starch viscosity perception has not been explored. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we demonstrate that saliva containing high levels of amylase has sufficient activity to rapidly hydrolyze a viscous starch solution in vitro. Furthermore, we show with time-intensity ratings, which track the digestion of starch during oral manipulation, that individuals with high amylase levels report faster and more significant decreases in perceived starch viscosity than people with low salivary amylase levels. Finally, we demonstrate that AMY1 CNVs predict an individual's amount and activity of salivary amylase and thereby, ultimately determine their perceived rate of oral starch viscosity thinning. CONCLUSIONS: By linking genetic variation and its consequent salivary enzymatic differences to the perceptual sequellae of these variations, we show that AMY1 copy number relates to salivary amylase concentration and enzymatic activity level, which, in turn, account for individual variation in the oral perception of starch viscosity. The profound individual differences in salivary amylase levels and salivary activity may contribute significantly to individual differences in dietary starch intake and, consequently, to overall nutritional status.},

In this study, shotgun-sequenced data from paired dental calculus and dentin samples from 48 globally distributed individuals are compared using a metagenomic approach. Overall, we find DNA from dental calculus is consistently more abundant and less contaminated than DNA from dentin. The majority of DNA in dental calculus is microbial and originates from the oral microbiome; however, a small but consistent proportion of DNA (mean 0.08\,{$\pm$}\,0.08\%, range 0.007\textendash 0.47\%) derives from the host genome. Host DNA content within dentin is variable (mean 13.70\,{$\pm$}\,18.62\%, range 0.003\textendash 70.14\%), and for a subset of dentin samples (15.21\%), oral bacteria contribute\,{$>$}\,20\% of total DNA. Human DNA in dental calculus is highly fragmented, and is consistently shorter than both microbial DNA in dental calculus and human DNA in paired dentin samples. Finally, we find that microbial DNA fragmentation patterns are associated with guanine-cytosine (GC) content, but not aspects of cellular structure.},

Recently, studies have attempted to reconstruct diet from archaeological dental calculus using archaeogenetic techniques. While dental calculus may provide a relatively stable environment for DNA preservation, the detection of plants and animals possibly consumed by an individual through DNA analysis is primarily hindered by microbial richness and incomplete reference databases. Moreover, high genomic similarity within eukaryotic groups - such as mammals - can obfuscate precise taxonomic identification. In the current study we demonstrate the challenges associated with accurate taxonomic identification and authentication of dietary taxa in ancient DNA data using both synthetic and ancient dental calculus datasets. We highlight common errors and sources of contamination across ancient DNA datasets, provide recommendations for dietary DNA validation, and call for caution in the interpretation of diet from dental calculus and other archaeological microbiome substrates.},

  abstract = {The ability of bacteria to produce extracellular polysaccharides has been regarded as an indication of biofilm-forming capacity. Therefore, the determination of the sugar content in bacterial samples becomes a significant parameter. The colorimetric methods currently used are rather sensitive to the nature of the sugars and therefore require knowledge of the sugar types present in the samples. Unfortunately, the types of sugars present in bacteria are generally unknown and often composed of a complex mixture. In this article, we propose an alternative method based on Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for the estimation of the total sugar content in bacterial samples. The method is based on a systematic treatment of FTIR spectra obtained from dried bacteria samples. It is assumed that the total sugar amount can be estimated from the area of characteristic bands between 970 and 1182cm-1. In parallel, the amide II band (1560\textendash 1530cm-1) associated with proteins, or the C\textendash H stretching region (2820\textendash 3020cm-1) associated with the biomass, can be used for normalization purposes. Therefore, the ratio of the band area in the sugar window over that of the amide II or C\textendash H stretching can be used to report the sugar content in bacterial samples. This method has been validated on model bacterial mixtures containing sugars, proteins, and DNA. Results with real bacterial samples are also provided and show conclusively that increased sugar contents in biofilms can be identified. The proposed FTIR approach requires minimal sample preparation and a single acquisition, is rapid, and may be applied to any kind of bacterial growth.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY In the oral cavity, indigenous bacteria are often associated with two major oral diseases, caries and periodontal diseases. These diseases seem to appear following an inbalance in the oral resident microbiota, leading to the emergence of potentially pathogenic bacteria. To define the process involved in caries and periodontal diseases, it is necessary to understand the ecology of the oral cavity and to identify the factors responsible for the transition of the oral microbiota from a commensal to a pathogenic relationship with the host. The regulatory forces influencing the oral ecosystem can be divided into three major categories: host related, microbe related, and external factors. Among host factors, secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) constitutes the main specific immune defense mechanism in saliva and may play an important role in the homeostasis of the oral microbiota. Naturally occurring SIgA antibodies that are reactive against a variety of indigenous bacteria are detectable in saliva. These antibodies may control the oral microbiota by reducing the adherence of bacteria to the oral mucosa and teeth. It is thought that protection against bacterial etiologic agents of caries and periodontal diseases could be conferred by the induction of SIgA antibodies via the stimulation of the mucosal immune system. However, elucidation of the role of the SIgA immune system in controlling the oral indigenous microbiota is a prerequisite for the development of effective vaccines against these diseases. The role of SIgA antibodies in the acquisition and the regulation of the indigenous microbiota is still controversial. Our review discusses the importance of SIgA among the multiple factors that control the oral microbiota. It describes the oral ecosystems, the principal factors that may control the oral microbiota, a basic knowledge of the secretory immune system, the biological functions of SIgA, and, finally, experiments related to the role of SIgA in oral microbial ecology.},

  abstract = {Abstract The difference between male and female values of quantitative traits depends on the distribution of the variables within each sex, increasing with the rise in the difference between male and female average values and with the decrease of the dispersion of measurements in both sexes. This paper deals with the sensitivity of some widely used indices (relative difference between male and female mean values (MDI), Student's t, and the so-called Bennett-Chakraborty-Majumder D coefficient) with respect to intrasexual variability. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance (KS) is suggested here as a further index of dimorphism, although it is not usually utilized for this purpose. The theoretical approach is accompanied by the analysis of empirical data (metric variables obtained from a sample of present Sardinians) and by computer simulations under various assumptions. Indices based on the difference between male and female average values are not able to evaluate fully the various aspects of dimorphism. Student's t proved to be an adequate measure of whole sex differences, both in real and in simulated samples, as intrasexual variability is included in its formulation. The D index also proved to be a good measure of undivided sexual dimorphism, as it is the result of formal examination, and from application to empirical or to simulated cases. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance gave the best performance both in formal examination and in the whole simulation results, as it takes into account intrasexual variability, and is applicable to any kind of distribution. In simulated cases it was sensitive to variations of means and variances, and it was able to evaluate variance dimorphism. Since the last three indices measure the combined effect of size and variance dimorphism, the joint use of the MDI index is suggested in order to isolate the relative contribution of the difference between the means.

It has been well documented that teeth are more resistant than bones to the taphonomic processes, and that the use of methods for age estimation based on dental imaging assessment are not only less invasive than those based on osseous analysis, but also have shown similar or superior accuracy in adults. To summarise the results of some of the recently most recently cited methods for dental age estimation in adults, based on odontometric dental imaging analysis, to establish which is more accurate, accessible, and simple. A literature search from several databases was conducted from January 1995 to July 2016 with previously defined inclusion criteria. Based on the findings of this review, it could be possible to suggest pulp/tooth area ratio calculation from first, upper canines and other single rooted teeth (lower premolars, upper central incisors), and a specific statistical analysis that considers the non-linear production of secondary dentine with age, as a reliable, easy, faster, and predictable method for dental age estimation in adults. The second recommended method is the pulp/tooth width\textendash length ratio calculation. The use of specific population formulae is recommended, but to include data of individuals from different groups of population in the same analysis is not discouraged. A minimum sample size of at least 120 participants is recommended to obtain more reliable results. Methods based on volume calculation are time consuming and still need improvement.},

  abstract = {Background: Most microorganisms in nature attach to surfaces and form matrix-embedded biofilms. Biofilms are highly structured and spatially organized, and are often composed of consortia of interacting microorganisms, termed microbial communities, the properties of which are more than the sum of the component species. Microbial gene expression alters markedly in biofilms; organisms communicate by gene transfer and by secretion of diffusible signalling molecules. Cells in biofilms are less susceptible to antimicrobial agents. Aim and Materials \& Methods: To comprehensively review the literature to determine whether dental plaque displays properties consistent with those of a typical biofilm and microbial community. Results: Novel microscopic and molecular techniques have demonstrated that plaque has a structured architecture with an extracellular matrix, and a diverse composition (around 50\% of cells are unculturable). The constituent species communicate by gene transfer, by secreted peptides (Gram-positive bacteria) and autoinducer-2 (Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria). These organisms are functionally organized for increased metabolic efficiency, greater resistance to stress and for enhanced virulence. Plaque formation has direct and indirect effects on gene expression. Conclusion: Dental plaque displays properties that are typical of biofilms and microbial communities in general, a clinical consequence of which is a reduced susceptibility to antimicrobial agents as well as pathogenic synergism.},

  abstract = {Dental plaque is a structurally- and functionally-organized biofilm. Plaque forms in an ordered way and has a diverse microbial composition that, in health, remains relatively stable over time (microbial homeostasis). The predominant species from diseased sites are different from those found in healthy sites, although the putative pathogens can often be detected in low numbers at normal sites. In dental caries, there is a shift toward community dominance by acidogenic and acidtolerating species such as mutans streptococci and lactobacilli, although other species with relevant traits may be involved. Strategies to control caries could include inhibition of biofilm development (e.g. prevention of attachment of cariogenic bacteria, manipulation of cell signaling mechanisms, delivery of effective antimicrobials, etc.), or enhancement of the host defenses. Additionally, these more conventional approaches could be augmented by interference with the factors that enable the cariogenic bacteria to escape from the normal homeostatic mechanisms that restrict their growth in plaque and out compete the organisms associated with health. Evidence suggests that regular conditions of low pH in plaque select for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. Therefore, the suppression of sugar catabolism and acid production by the use of metabolic inhibitors and nonfermentable artificial sweeteners in snacks, or the stimulation of saliva flow, could assist in the maintenance of homeostasis in plaque. Arguments will be presented that an appreciation of ecological principles will enable a more holistic approach to be taken in caries control.},

However, in the absence of adequate oral hygiene, dental plaque can accumulate beyond levels compatible with oral health. This leads to shifts in the balance of the predominant bacteria away from those associated with health; such shifts can predispose a site to caries or periodontal diseases. Treatment should be designed, therefore, to control rather than to eliminate dental plaque. Possible strategies to maintain the stability and beneficial properties of the natural oral microflora include the stimulation of saliva flow for an extended period directly after a meal, the avoidance of fermentable carbohydrates during between-meal periods, and improvements to oral hygiene, for example, by using products containing antiplaque or antimicrobial agents},

Key physiological factors that were identified as significant in modulating the microflora included the local pH, redox potential (Eh), and nutrient availability. Increases in mutans streptococci and lactobacilli occur at sites with caries; growth of these species is selectively enhanced at low pH. In contrast, periodontal diseases are associated with plaque accumulation, followed by an inflammatory host response. The increases in Gram-negative, proteolytic, and obligately anaerobic bacteria reflect a low redox potential and a change in nutrient status due to the increased flow of gingival crevicular fluid (GCF). Consequently, physiological strategies for oral biofilm control should focus on reducing the frequency of low pH in plaque by (i) inhibiting acid production, (ii) using sugar substitutes, and (iii) promoting alkali generation from arginine or urea supplements. Similarly, strategies to make the pocket environment less favorable to periodontopathogens include (i) anti-inflammatory agents to reduce the flow of (and hence nutrient supply by) GCF, (ii) bacterial protease inhibitors, and (iii) redox agents to raise the Ehh locally. Most laboratory and clinical findings support the concept of physiological control. However, some data suggest that the ordered structure and metabolically interactive organization of mature dental plaque could generate a community with a high level of homeostasis that is relatively resistant to deliberate external manipulation.},

  abstract = {Models of dental caries (laboratory, animal, and human in situ models) vary markedly in their microbiological complexity. Laboratory models range from mono-cultures of cariogenic species providing an acidic challenge to enamel, to the development of diverse mixed cultures growing on a habitatsimulating medium in an artificial mouth or chemostat. The latter systems are of value in determining either mechanisms of action or cause-and-effect relationships\textemdash e.g., between dietary components or antimicrobial agents and the microflora. Laboratory models have also shown that the sensitivity of oral bacteria to inhibitors is markedly reduced when growing in biofilms such as dental plaque. Animal models have proved unequivocally that caries is an infectious and transmissible disease. Their use has enabled comparisons to be made of (a) the cariogenic potential of different bacterial species, (b) the role of the diet, and (c) the effects of potential anti-caries agents. It has been claimed that no caries-protective agent currently in use has failed a rodent test. In situ human models have been designed to permit the development of "natural" plaque on standardized enamel surfaces freely exposed to the human oral environment. The microflora that develops on unadulterated surfaces is similar in composition to that found at comparable sites on vital teeth. Demineralization can be accelerated by the inoculation of additional cariogenic bacteria coupled with either intra- or extra-oral sucrose rinses. The increased realism associated with the transition from laboratory to human in situ models is countered by a reduced ability to control or manipulate the system for experimental purposes. Thus, a hierarchy of tests is needed for the study of anti-caries agents, each requiring a varying degree of microbiological complexity.},

Its degree of preservation is, therefore, crucial and several approaches are used to determine it. Spectroscopic techniques provide a cost-effective, non-destructive method to investigate the molecular structure, especially when combined with multivariate statistics (chemometric approach). In this study, we used FTIR-ATR spectroscopy to characterise collagen extracted from skeletons recovered from necropoleis in NW Spain spanning from the Bronze Age to eighteenth century AD. Principal components analysis was performed on a selection of bands and structural equation models (SEM) were developed to relate the collagen quality indicators to collagen structural change. Four principal components represented: (i) Cp1, transformations of the backbone protein with a residual increase in proteoglycans; (ii) Cp2, protein transformations not accompanied by changes in proteoglycans abundance; (iii) Cp3, variations in aliphatic side chains and (iv) Cp4, absorption of the OH of carbohydrates and amide. Highly explanatory SEM models were obtained for the traditional collagen quality indicators (collagen yield, C, N, C:N), but no relationship was found between quality and {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N ratios. The observed decrease in C and N content and increase in C:N ratios is controlled by the degradation of protein backbone components and the relative preservation of carbon-rich compounds, proteoglycans and, to a lesser extent, aliphatic moieties. Our results suggest that FTIR-ATR is an ideal technique for collagen characterization/pre-screening for palaeodiet, mobility and radiocarbon research.},

The aim of this review is to evaluate the available literature concerning the effect of caffeine ingestion on fluid balance and to formulate targeted and evidence-based advice on caffeinated beverages in the context of optimum hydration. Method A literature search was performed using the Medline database of articles published in the medical and scientific literature for the period of January 1966\textendash March 2002. Subject headings and key words used in this search were: tea, coffee, caffeine, diuresis, fluid balance and water-electrolyte balance. A secondary search was performed using the bibliographies of publications identified in the initial search. Results The available literature suggests that acute ingestion of caffeine in large doses (at least 250\textendash 300 mg, equivalent to the amount found in 2\textendash 3 cups of coffee or 5\textendash 8 cups of tea) results in a short-term stimulation of urine output in individuals who have been deprived of caffeine for a period of days or weeks. A profound tolerance to the diuretic and other effects of caffeine develops, however, and the actions are much diminished in individuals who regularly consume tea or coffee. Doses of caffeine equivalent to the amount normally found in standard servings of tea, coffee and carbonated soft drinks appear to have no diuretic action. Conclusion The most ecologically valid of the published studies offers no support for the suggestion that consumption of caffeine-containing beverages as part of a normal lifestyle leads to fluid loss in excess of the volume ingested or is associated with poor hydration status. Therefore, there would appear to be no clear basis for refraining from caffeine containing drinks in situations where fluid balance might be compromised.},

  abstract = {This study uses molar tooth crown heights of skeletons excavated from Poundbury cemetery, Dorset in order to evaluate Brothwell's (1963) system for scoring molar wear for age estimation in adult skeletons from archaeological sites. Among the juveniles a highly significant relationship was found between crown height and dental age, confirming the utility of crown height in the study of individual age at death. In the group as a whole, wear (as measured by crown height) on teeth which are occlusal partners is strongly correlated, hence information loss by considering only upper or lower teeth is minor for the purposes of ageing. The remainder of the paper concentrates on mandibular molars. It appears that mandibular first and second molars wear at similar rates throughout life. Wear on the third molar is more variable and hence should be given less weight in age determination. The results confirm the value of dental wear for estimating age at death, and comparison of crown heights with Brothwell's stages confirm the value of his scheme for scoring wear. However the definitions of some of Brothwell's stages were found to be problematic, and in this light some revisions to his scheme are suggested. There are problems in applying tooth wear data to age older adults in archaeological populations, particularly as many of these show substantial ante-mortem loss of teeth. It is suggested that for archaeological populations young adults (aged about 17\textendash 35) may be distinguished from mature adults (aged about 35\textendash 55) on the basis of dental wear using Brothwell's chart. In archaeological groups, adults showing losses of more than about 50\% of their teeth ante-mortem are probably aged over about 55 years at death.},

The study group is from mediaeval Wharram Percy, where existing {$\delta$}15N data indicate cessation of breastfeeding occurred by about 24\,months post-partum. The hypothesis tested is that there should be an increase in dental wear as breast milk is replaced with solid foods during weaning. Incisor wear is monitored using crown heights, measured from photographs using image analysis. Results provide little evidence for alteration in incisor wear rates with the attenuation of breastfeeding, perhaps because abrasive foods were used as supplements well before breastfeeding declined.

Firstly, to investigate the nature of the relationship between wear on the deciduous molars and dental age. Secondly, to evaluate, using crown height, two existing methods of recording deciduous molar wear: the measurement of the percent of the occlusal surface made up of exposed dentine described by Clement and Freyne (2012), and the ordinal wear stage method of Dawson and Robson Brown (2013). The study material is immature skeletal remains (N~=~76, dental age range 15 months\textendash 11.5~yrs) from a British Mediaeval site. Results show that crown height bears an approximately linear relationship with dental age for both first and second deciduous molars, and regression residuals are homoscedastic suggesting little inter-individual variation in wear rates. The second molar wears at a faster rate and its crown height bears a closer relationship with dental age. In the second molar, percent dentine exposure bears a non-linear relationship with dental age and with crown height, and for both molars the regression residuals of percent dentine exposed upon dental age are heteroscedastic. The ordinal wear stages of Dawson and Robson Brown (2013) are strongly correlated with dental age but different wear stages may correspond to dissimilar increments of crown height. Molar crown height is a sensitive and direct measure of occlusal wear, and its homoscedastic, linear relationship with dental age facilitates controlling for the effects of age when dental wear is used to study childhood diet in archaeological populations.},

The ubiquity, variety and complexity of biofilms is now widely accepted by microbiologists. While they are associated with many beneficial functions such as nutrient cycling, bioremediation and colonization resistance, adverse effects including recalcitrance, their involvement in industrial fouling, contamination and infection have made biofilms a priority research topic. We know that most biofilms, other than within certain infections and laboratory flasks, are composed of multiple species and that there is arguably no unifying biofilm architecture. Biofilms do however share certain properties including the presence of gradients of nutrients, gasses and metabolic products, relatively increased cell density, deposition of extracellular polymeric substances and marked recalcitrance towards antimicrobial treatments. Much of our understanding of biofilm physiology and micro-ecology originates from experiments using in vitro biofilm models. Broadly speaking, such models may be used to replicate environmental conditions within the laboratory or to focus on selected variables such a growth rate or fluid flow, etc. This chapter provides an overview of some commonly used biofilm models including microtitre plate systems, flow cells, the constant depth film fermenter, annular reactors and the perfused biofilm fermenter. While perfused biofilm fermenters, in particular, enable growth rate to be controlled within thin, relatively homogenous, quasi steady-state biofilms through modulation of flow rate nutrient availability, other models provide representative modelling of in situ conditions where steady states may be uncommon.},

  abstract = {Aims: (i) To compare the effects of feeding protocols upon the composition and stability of dental plaque microcosms formed in constant-depth film fermenters (CDFF). (ii) To evaluate the utility of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and culture methodologies for the investigation of such models. Methods and Results: Microcosms were established anaerobically in the CDFFs from freshly collected saliva. These were fed either with artificial saliva alone (famine) or combined with discontinuous feeding (feast\textendash famine). Culture and 16s rDNA sequencing indicated that supplemental feeding gave ca. 2 log increases in Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Prevotella buccae. Feast\textendash famine microcosms were then further characterized by DGGE using primers specific for the V2\textendash V3 region of eubacterial rDNA. These gave single major bands with pure cultures (eight species) and resolved all strains apart from Lact. rhamnosus and Actinomyces naeslundii. Whilst culture with selective media indicated a degree of stability and reproducibility between replicate microcosms, DGGE showed a considerable degree of variability that related to several putatively uncultured bacteria. Conclusions: Feast\textendash famine regimes altered community composition. DGGE analyses identified putatively unculturable species and demonstrated variability between replicate fermenters. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study demonstrates the utility of DGGE for the analysis of dental plaque, especially with respect to unculturable bacteria. Results question the assumptions of reproducibility of plaque microcosms established in non-replicated CDFFs made on the basis of selective media. Feeding regimes, particularly those involving complex nutrients, will dramatically affect population dynamics.},

However, it can be difficult to macroscopically distinguish subtle hypomineralised opacities from post-mortem staining, unrelated to developmental defects. To overcome this difficulty, we have used non-destructive x-ray microtomography to estimate the mineral density of enamel. Using a sample of deciduous teeth from a prehistoric burial site in Northeast Thailand, we demonstrate that it is possible to determine whether observed enamel discolourations were more likely to be true hypomineralised lesions or artefacts occurring as the result of taphonomic effects. The analyses of our sample showed no evidence of hypomineralised areas in teeth with macroscopic discolouration, which had previously been thought, on the basis of macroscopic observation, to be hypomineralisations indicative of growth disruption. Our results demonstrate that x-ray microtomography can be a powerful, non-destructive method for the investigation of the presence and severity of hypomineralisation, and that diagnosis of enamel hypomineralisation based on macroscopic observation of buried teeth should be made with caution. This method makes it possible to identify true dental defects that are indicative of growth disruptions.}

We recommend dropping the NHST paradigm\textemdash and the p-value thresholds intrinsic to it\textemdash as the default statistical paradigm for research, publication, and discovery in the biomedical and social sciences. Specifically, we propose that the p-value be demoted from its threshold screening role and instead, treated continuously, be considered along with currently subordinate factors (e.g., related prior evidence, plausibility of mechanism, study design and data quality, real world costs and benefits, novelty of finding, and other factors that vary by research domain) as just one among many pieces of evidence. We have no desire to ``ban'' p-values or other purely statistical measures. Rather, we believe that such measures should not be thresholded and that, thresholded or not, they should not take priority over the currently subordinate factors. We also argue that it seldom makes sense to calibrate evidence as a function of p-values or other purely statistical measures. We offer recommendations for how our proposal can be implemented in the scientific publication process as well as in statistical decision making more broadly.},

Composite scores for two groups of sutures, lateral-anterior and vault systems, which are used to provide estimates of age-at-death, have been developed from a sample of 236 crania from the Hamann-Todd Collection. A variety of tests show that the lateralanterior sutures are superior to the sutures of the vault, that ectocranial is superior to endocranial observation, and that age estimates are independent of race and sex. It is concluded that suture closure can provide valuable estimates of age-at-death in both archaeological and forensic contexts when used in conjunction with other skeletal age indicators.},

The sample was comprised of 67 permanent teeth, obtained from 37 individuals aged 20\textendash 91 years. Age was predicted according to the methods proposed by Lamendin et al. (LAM), Bang and Ramm (BR), and the quantification of tooth cementum annulations (TCA). TCA was found to be most accurate in all age groups. Its mean absolute error of the estimated age was about half as high as the mean absolute error for both LAM and BR. BR achieved approximately the same mean absolute error as TCA for old adults only. LAM displayed the highest precision in the young and the old age group whereas TCA was more precise in the middle age group. TCA was found to be the most precise method when the precision was calculated for all ages. Considering the bias, all methods displayed a tendency to overestimate age in young and to underestimate it in old specimens. The exception to this rule was TCA, which provided unbiased estimates for young adults. The higher accuracy and precision recommends favouring TCA over LAM and BR, provided that the required know-how and equipment are available.},

However, little is known about the biological effects of such demographic changes during the Neolithic. In the present work, we test the relationship between diachronic changes in population size, relative exposure to developmental stressors, and patterns of dental fluctuating asymmetry in the Neolithic population of \c{C}atalh\"oy\"uk (Turkey, 7,100\textendash 5,950\,cal\,BC). Materials and Methods We calculate fluctuating asymmetry of mesio-distal and bucco-lingual diameters of upper and lower permanent canines and first and second molars on a large (N\,=\,259) sample representing adults of both sexes and various age classes. Results Results show only a moderate decrease of fluctuating asymmetry during the late phase of occupation of the site, possibly linked to a decrease in population density, and no differences in asymmetry between sexes. Discussion Though preliminary, our data reflect the presence of developmental stressors throughout the occupation of the site, albeit with a slight improvement in living conditions during the latest periods of occupation. At the same time, these data confirm the key role of diet as buffer against the detrimental effects of fluctuating demographic pressures on the biology of prehistoric human populations.}

Evidence of age may be deduced from the bones or the teeth, which tend to survive much longer than other parts of the skeleton, provide the sole basis for an age estimation. Most of the published work refers to the forensic aspects of this subject and shows that age can be assessed from the teeth during the period of tooth development that is up to about 18 years of age with a fairly high degree of accuracy. In assessing age from dentitions that are immature, use is commonly made of a chart prepared by Schour and Massler (1941), published in slightly modified form by the American Dental Association and reproduced in many textbooks. In recent years, there has been an accumulation of information about the progression of tooth growth by means of which revision of the chart could be undertaken. Little appears to be known about possible racial differences in the chronology of tooth development and tooth growth. Racial differences could, however, reasonably be expected to be of small degree because the times of tooth eruption, which are more affected than tooth growth by sex differences, hormonal disturbances, and dietary deficiencies show only relatively slight racial differences.}

There is interest in predicting plasma or whole-blood concentrations from OF concentrations; however, the relationship between these matrices is incompletely characterized because of few controlled drug-administration studies.Ten male daily cannabis smokers received around-the-clock escalating 20-mg oral {$\Delta$}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, dronabinol) doses (40\textendash 120 mg/day) for 8 days. Plasma and OF samples were simultaneously collected before, during, and after dosing. OF THC, 11-hydroxy-THC and 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC (THCCOOH) were quantified by GC-MS at 0.5-{$\mu$}g/L, 0.5-{$\mu$}g/L, and 7.5-ng/L limits of quantification (LOQs), respectively. In plasma, the LOQs were 0.25 {$\mu$}g/L for THC and THCCOOH, and 0.5 {$\mu$}g/L for 11-hydroxy-THC.Despite multiple oral THC administrations each day and increasing plasma THC concentrations, OF THC concentrations generally decreased over time, reflecting primarily previously self-administered smoked cannabis. The logarithms of the THC concentrations in oral fluid and plasma were not significantly correlated (r = -0.10; P = 0.065). The OF and plasma THCCOOH concentrations, albeit with 1000-fold higher concentrations in plasma, increased throughout dosing. The logarithms of OF and plasma THCCOOH concentrations were significantly correlated (r = 0.63; P \&lt; 0.001), although there was high interindividual variation. A high OF/plasma THC ratio and a high OF THC/THCCOOH ratio indicated recent cannabis smoking.OF monitoring does not reliably detect oral dronabinol intake. The time courses of THC and THCCOOH concentrations in plasma and OF were different after repeated oral THC doses, and high interindividual variation was observed. For these reasons, OF cannabinoid concentrations cannot predict concurrent plasma concentrations.}

Commonly used reporting guidelines for observational or genetic epidemiology studies lack key features specific to microbiome studies. Therefore, a multidisciplinary group of microbiome epidemiology researchers adapted guidelines for observational and genetic studies to culture-independent human microbiome studies, and also developed new reporting elements for laboratory, bioinformatics and statistical analyses tailored to microbiome studies. The resulting tool, called `Strengthening The Organization and Reporting of Microbiome Studies' (STORMS), is composed of a 17-item checklist organized into six sections that correspond to the typical sections of a scientific publication, presented as an editable table for inclusion in supplementary materials. The STORMS checklist provides guidance for concise and complete reporting of microbiome studies that will facilitate manuscript preparation, peer review, and reader comprehension of publications and comparative analysis of published results.},

  abstract = {Objective: To evaluate roller coaster facilitation of calyceal renal calculi passage using a functional pyelocalyceal renal model. Methods: A previously described adult ureteroscopy and renoscopy simulator (Ideal Anatomic) was modified and remolded to function as a patient surrogate. Three renal calculi of different sizes from the patient who provided the original computed tomographic urograph on which the simulator was based were used. The renal calculi were suspended in urine in the model and taken for 20 rides on the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad roller coaster at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. The roller coaster rides were analyzed using variables of renal calculi volume, calyceal location, model position on the roller coaster, and renal calculi passage. Results: Sixty renal calculi rides were analyzed. Independent of renal calculi volume and calyceal location, front seating on the roller coaster resulted in a passage rate of 4 of 24. Independent of renal calculi volume and calyceal location, rear seating on the roller coaster resulted in a passage rate of 23 of 36. Independent of renal calculi volume in rear seating, calyceal location differed in passage rates, with an upper calyceal calculi passage rate of 100\%; a middle calyceal passage rate of 55.6\%; and a lower calyceal passage rate of 40.0\%. Conclusion: The functional pyelocalyceal renal model serves as a functional patient surrogate to evaluate activities that facilitate calyceal renal calculi passage. The rear seating position on the roller coaster led to the most renal calculi passages.},

Focusing on different contents, laboratory procedures require specific treatments that necessitate the same material and are generally mutually exclusive; therefore, the low quantity of the starting material is often the main limiting factor for gathering data. Here, we compare different combinations of laboratory procedures in order to identify the best strategy for simultaneously extracting DNA and isolating plant residue. Preliminary tests were performed on fresh plant materials to verify the effects of the DNA extraction protocols on starch grains and phytoliths. Different combined experimental procedures were successively applied to the dental calculus of three medieval individuals. Our results confirmed that authentic genetic data could be recovered from ancient dental calculus using protocols commonly used for extracting DNA from ancient bones and teeth, and the residual pellet could be successfully used for morphological characterization of plant residues. In addition, we confirmed that, although most DNA within calculus is microbial, the whole human mitochondrial genome could be reconstructed using target enrichment techniques.},

In the present study we applied both metagenomic and microscopic analysis on ancient human dental calculus in order to obtain a cross-section of the life conditions in a population of central Italy belonging to the Copper Age culture of Rinaldone (IV millennium BCE). The metagenomic profile suggested an agricultural subsistence and a dietary regimen particularly enriched in complex carbohydrates with low soluble fiber. Even bacterial functional profile seems to indicate an almost exclusive carbohydrates intake that could have favoured the occurrence of nutritional stress in the individuals. Exploring the diversity of the plant food consumed, we detected direct evidence of cereals such as wheat and/or barley, and found signals of the use of leaf vegetables, thus providing additional information on human/environment relationship. The presence of oral pathogens, even if at low abundance ({$<$}0.1\%), can be related to the high consumption of carbohydrates and finds correspondence with the palaeopathological evidence. In conclusion, starting from very minute amounts of ancient dental calculus, our molecular and microscopic analysis jointly provided complementary data in support of past life condition reconstruction in ancient human populations.},

Teeth (n = 764) from 17 males and 11 females were examined microscopically to document unusual wear, assess wear patterns and oral lesions as evidence of habitual behavior, and determine their effect on the oral health of this population. Five atypical wear types were observed: occlusal facets, occlusal excessive load, labial vertical striae, labial horizontal striae, and interproximal striae. Three oral lesions were recorded: chipping, periapical lesions, and dental tilting. Results indicate that teeth were used in a habitual manner at Ajvide, based on the morphology and regularity of the patterns of atypical wear. Differences were observed between the sexes, indicating gender-related differences in the habitual use of teeth. Some wear categories showed a significant correlation with age, signifying increased or accumulated wear with age. Statistically significant positive correlations were found in the molars between occlusal excessive load wear and periapical lesions as well as tilting. Other apparent links were also observed between chipping and vertical striae as well as excessive load, although these were not significant. This suggests a relationship between dental wear and dental pathologies at this site, suggesting that habitual use of teeth indirectly affected the general oral health at the site. Wear patterns, furthermore, seem to mirror both frequent activities as well as single events. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2008. \textcopyright{} 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}

This study aims to explore oral health and dental attrition during the late Bronze Age in order to explore health outcomes in different subgroups as well as aspects of foodways and changes in subsistence strategies during the second millennium BCE in northwest China. To do this, the skeletal remains of adult individuals associated with the Siwa material culture (1400\textendash 1100 BC) from the Mogou site (n = 28) were macroscopically assessed and compared with previously published data derived from a subsample of individuals associated with Qijia period material culture complex (1750\textendash 1400 BC) from the same site. The results show that the Siwa-period population experienced a high frequency of carious lesions and antemortem tooth loss associated with advanced attrition (of both molars and nonmolar teeth), which did not vary significantly by sex. Females had a higher prevalence of carious lesions and antemortem tooth loss than did males, while males had a higher prevalence of dental calculus. These male/female health outcomes are also attested during the earlier Qijia period at the Mogou site. The Siwa period differs from the Qijia in that females experienced slightly worse attrition than their predecessors. Overall, oral health does not diverge significantly between the Qijia and Siwa periods, suggesting that the factors that contributed to oral health including dietary practices may have persisted diachronically for individuals buried at this site.},

Calcium uptake or calcification of Streptococcus mutans C180-2, proven to be an acidogenic and cariogenic strain, was compared with calcium uptake and calcification of Corynebacterium (Bacterionema) matruchotii, known as a ready calcifier. Bacteria were grown on Brain Heart Infusion Agar (BHIA) and on well-buffered semi-synthetic E-agar, both containing 1.4 mmol/L calcium, 2 g/L glucose, initial pH 7.4. Calcium uptake from BHIA by C. matruchotii (25 mmol Ca/kg wet bacterial cell mass), but not by S. mutans, was found. Grown as a plaque-like lawn on E-agar, the S. mutans cell mass concentrated calcium to 63 {$\pm$} 11 mmol/ kg compared with 145 {$\pm$} 61 mmol/kg in C. matruchotii. X-ray diffraction confirmed the presence of crystalline apatite in the bacterial cell masses. Electron microscopy revealed crystals and mineralized deposits in both organisms. Heavy calcifications in some cells of S. mutans were seen. Calcification was partly inhibited by magnesium ion and by methanehydroxybisphosphonate. S. sobrinus 6715, as well as freshly isolated S. mutans and S. sobrinus from patients, concentrated very large quantities of calcium, up to 500-fold from the medium, when maintained for several weeks on E-agar of initial pH 7.6. Our observations widen the view on acidogenic bacteria as mineralization agents and support the notion that members of the mutans group of streptococci may be involved in events that trigger heavy intracellular calcifications and, possibly, dental calculus formation.}

Bone and teeth are classic examples of biomaterials with unique biomechanical properties that are crucial to their function. The collagen-based apatite mineralization and the important function of noncollagenous proteins are similar in dentin and bone; however, enamel is formed in a unique amelogenin-containing protein matrix. While the structure and organic composition of enamel are different from those of dentin and bone, the principal molecular mechanisms of protein\textendash protein interactions, protein self-assembly, and control of crystallization events by the organic matrix are common among these apatite-containing tissues. This review briefly summarizes enamel and dentin matrix components and their interactions with other extracellular matrix components and calcium ions in mediating the mineralization process. We highlight the crystallization events that are controlled by the protein matrix and their interactions in the extracellular matrix during enamel and dentin biomineralization. Strategies for peptide-inspired biomimetic growth of tooth enamel and bioinspired mineralization of collagen to stimulate repair of demineralized dentin and bone tissue engineering are also addressed.},

In vivo enzymatic degradation of wheat starch caused marked drops in interdental plaque pH to 4.75 measured by intraoral plaque pH telemetry, most probably as the result of the fermentation of low molecular weight maltodextrins by plaque bacteria.

  abstract = {In later pre-Columbian prehistory (post AD 1000), the adaptation and intensification of maize agriculture and its correlate of aggregate village settlement (i.e. Mississippianization) is temporally and geographically variable. In the Midwest, consequential to the florescence of the major ceremonial centre of Cahokia (AD 1050\textendash 1300), the Mississippi River Valley alluvial plain in Illinois, known as the American Bottom, became a core area of this subsistence-settlement change. Much archaeological research has traced aspects of this transition in the Lower and Middle Illinois River Valley, but little is known outside of these areas. A skeletal sample from the remote hinterland area of the Upper Mississippi River in west-central Illinois was examined for arguable paleopathological correlates of sedentism (treponemal disease) and Mississippianization (tuberculosis). The Schroeder Mounds (AD 900\textendash 1100) adult skeletal sample (N\,=\,53) exhibited a high frequency of treponemal disease (13.2\textendash 15.1\%). This result is consistent with paleopathological literature linking a 9+\,\% pre-Columbian North American prevalence with sedentism, challenging archaeologically based inferences that the hinterland was occupied by mobile forager-horticulturalists. A hallmark of Mississippianization is the presence of diagnostic cases of tuberculosis. No cases were observed in the Schroeder sample, suggesting a pre-Mississippian subsistence-settlement pattern.

  abstract = {Each species of intestinal bacteria requires a nutritional source to maintain its population in the intestine. Dietary factors are considered to be major nutrients; however, evidence directly explaining the in situ utilization of dietary factors is limited. Microscale bacterial distribution would provide clues to understand bacterial lifestyle and nutrient utilization. However, the detailed bacterial localization around dietary factors in the intestine remains uninvestigated. Therefore, we explored microscale habitats in the murine intestine by using histology and fluorescent in situ hybridization, focusing on dietary factors. This approach successfully revealed several types of bacterial colonization. In particular, bifidobacterial colonization and adhesion on granular starch was frequently and commonly observed in the jejunum and distal colon. To identify the bacterial composition of areas around starch granules and areas without starch, laser microdissection and next-generation sequencing-based 16S rRNA microbial profiling was performed. It was found that Bifidobacteriaceae were significantly enriched by 4.7 fold in peri-starch areas compared to ex-starch areas. This family solely consisted of Bifidobacterium pseudolongum. In contrast, there was no significant enrichment among the other major families. This murine intestinal B. pseudolongum had starch-degrading activity, confirmed by isolation from the mouse feces and in vitro analysis. Collectively, our results demonstrate the significance of starch granules as a major habitat and potential nutritional niche for murine intestinal B. pseudolongum. Moreover, our results suggest that colonizing bifidobacteria effectively utilize starch from the closest location and maintain the location. This may be a bacterial strategy to monopolize solid dietary nutrients.

  abstract = {The formation, development, and dissolution of hard deposits such as calculus are complex processes that involve numerous calcium phosphate phases as well as the interaction of these ions with organic molecules. Although formation is determined by thermodynamic driving forces, kinetic factors are also important determinants for the precipitation of specific calcium phosphate phases. The overall process, therefore, may involve the formation of metastable intermediates which may subsequently transform into the more stable hard deposits observed in vivo. A knowledge of the kinetics of growth of both individual calcium phosphate phases and their mixtures is important for elucidating the mechanism of calculus formation. Although salivary proteins are effective inhibitors of the mineralization reactions that take place in dental plaque, once adsorbed, their conformation may change to present surfaces that catalyze the nucleation of mineral phases. The variable pH conditions in plaque, expressed in terms of free ionic concentrations, will markedly alter the supersaturations with respect to typical calcium phosphate precursor phases such as dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) and octacalcium phosphate (OCP). Physical-chemical studies have shown that the mineralization of all the calcium phosphate phases is controlled by reactions at the surface rather than by diffusion of lattice ions through the contacting liquid phase. This makes the rates of reaction very sensitive to ions and molecules in the solution that may adsorb at the active growth sites and, while not significantly incorporating into the precipitated crystal phases, markedly influences the rates of mineralization and demineralization. In addition, the molar ratios of calcium and phosphate lattice ions may also influence the rates of reaction. A complete elucidation of the mechanism of calculus formation must hinge on a physical-chemical understanding of these contributing factors.},

  abstract = {Background/aim: Alkali generation by oral bacteria plays a key role in plaque pH homeostasis and may be a major impediment to the development of dental caries. To determine if the capacity of oral samples to produce ammonia from arginine or urea was related to caries experience, the arginine deiminase system (ADS) and urease activity in saliva and dental plaque samples were measured in 45 adult subjects. Methods: The subjects were divided into three groups according to caries status; 13 caries-free (CF) individuals (decayed, missing, and filled teeth = 0); 21 caries-active (CA) individuals (decayed teeth {$\geq$} 4); and 11 caries-experienced (CE) individuals (decayed teeth = 0; missing and filled teeth {$>$} 0). Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the proportion of certain acid- or alkali-producing organisms in the samples. Results: The amount of ammonia generated from the test substrates by plaque samples was generally higher than that produced by salivary samples in all groups. Significantly higher levels of salivary ADS activity and plaque urease activity were observed in CF subjects compared to CA subjects (P = 0.0004 and P = 0.014, respectively). The proportions of Streptococcus mutans from saliva and dental plaque of CA subjects were significantly higher than those from the CF group (P = 0.0153 and P = 0.0009, respectively). In the CA group, there was an inverse relationship between urease activity and the levels of S. mutans (P {$<$} 0.0001). Conclusion: This study supports the theory that increased caries risk is associated with reduced alkali-generating capacity of the bacteria colonizing the oral cavity; providing compelling evidence to further our understanding of oral alkali-generation in health and disease.},

Since the release of salivary enzyme alpha-amylase was reported to react to physiological and psychological stressors, we set out to investigate human salivary alpha-amylase changes employing a reliable laboratory stress protocol to investigate the reactivity of salivary alpha-amylase to a brief period of psychosocial stress. In a within-subject repeated-measures design, 24 healthy adults were exposed to the TSST and a control condition on separate days with randomized sequence. Salivary alpha-amylase, salivary cortisol and heart rate were repeatedly measured before, during and after both conditions. Significant differences between psychosocial stress and the rest condition in alpha-amylase activity [F(3.74,86.06)=4.52; P=0.003], cortisol levels [F(4.21,88.32)=12.48; P{$<$}0.001] and heart rate [F(1,22)=81.15; P{$<$}0.001] were observed, with marked increases before and after stress. The data corroborate findings from other studies that showed increased levels of alpha-amylase before and after psychological stress. We discuss the role of salivary alpha-amylase as a promising candidate for a reliable, noninvasive marker of psychosocial stress.},

These analyses involve a review of metrics and oral pathologies, micro-fossils preserved in the mineralized dental plaque, macrowear, and buccal microwear. Our results suggest that these complementary approaches support the assumption about a critical change in dental conditions and status with the introduction of Neolithic foodstuff and habits. However, we warn that different methodologies applied here provide data at different scales of resolution for detecting such changes and a multipronged approach to the study of dental collections is needed for a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of diachronic changes.},

Several studies have identified the core members of this microbial community; however, the factors that determine oral microbiome composition are not well understood. In this study, we exam the salivary oral microbiome of 1,049 Atlantic Canadians using 16S rRNA gene sequencing to determine which dietary, lifestyle, and anthropometric features play a role in shaping microbial community composition. Features that were identified as being significantly associated with overall composition then were additionally examined for genera, amplicon sequence variants, and predicted pathway abundances that were associated with these features. Several associations were replicated in an additional secondary validation data set. Overall, we found that several anthropometric measurements, including waist-hip ratio (WHR), height, and fat-free mass, as well as age and sex, were associated with overall oral microbiome structure in both our exploratory and validation data sets. We were unable to validate any dietary impacts on overall taxonomic oral microbiome composition but did find evidence to suggest potential contributions from factors such as the number of vegetable and refined grain servings an individual consumes. Interestingly, each one of these factors on its own was associated with only minor shifts in the overall taxonomic composition of the oral microbiome, suggesting that future biomarker identification for several diseases associated with the oral microbiome can be undertaken without the worry of confounding factors obscuring biological signals. IMPORTANCE The human oral cavity is inhabited by a diverse community of microbes, known as the human oral microbiome. These microbes play a role in maintaining both oral and systemic health and, as such, have been proposed to be useful biomarkers of disease. However, to identify these biomarkers, we first need to determine the composition and variation of the healthy oral microbiome. In this report, we investigate the oral microbiome of 1,049 healthy individuals to determine which genera and amplicon sequence variants are commonly found between individual oral microbiomes. We then further investigate how lifestyle, anthropometric, and dietary choices impact overall microbiome composition. Interestingly, the results from this investigation showed that while many features were significantly associated with oral microbiome composition, no single biological factor explained a variation larger than 2\%. These results indicate that future work on biomarker detection may be encouraged by the lack of strong confounding factors.}

In the first stage, we find a confidence interval for the value of the explanatory variable which corresponds to the given future value of the response. In the second stage, we enlarge the confidence interval found in the first stage to form a confidence interval called, calibration interval, for the value of the explanatory variable which corresponds to the theoretical mean value of the future observation. In finding the confidence interval in the first stage, we have used the method based on hypothesis testing and percentile bootstrap. When the errors are normally distributed, the coverage probability of resulting calibration interval based on hypothesis testing is comparable to that of the classical calibration interval. In the case of non normal errors, the coverage probability of the calibration interval based on hypothesis testing is much closer to the target value than that of the calibration interval based on percentile bootstrap.},

Materials and methods The proposed method was developed using 165 crania from the documented Athens Collection and tested on 20 Cretan crania. It is based on digital photographs of the lateral view of the cranium, drawing of the profile of three sexually dimorphic structures and calculation of variables that express the shape of these structures. Results The combinations of variables that provide optimum discrimination between sexes are identified by means of binary logistic regression and discriminant analysis. The best cross-validated results are obtained when variables from all three structures are combined and range from 75.8 to 85.1\% and 81.1 to 94.6\% for males and females, respectively. The success rate is 86.3\textendash 94.1\% for males and 83.9\textendash 93.5\% for females when half of the sample is used for training and the rest for prediction. Correct classification for the Cretan material based upon the standards developed for the Athens sample was 80\textendash 90\% for the optimum combinations of discriminant variables.

When S. gordonii cells are pretreated with amylase, amylase bound to AbpA facilitates growth with starch as a primary nutrition source. The goal of this study was to explore possible regulatory effects of starch, starch metabolites and amylase on the expression of S. gordonii AbpA. An amylase ligand-binding assay was used to assess the expression of AbpA in culture supernatants and on bacterial cells from S. gordonii grown in defined medium supplemented with 1\% starch, 0.5 mg ml-1 amylase, with starch and amylase together, or with various linear malto-oligosaccharides. Transcription of abpA was determined by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. AbpA was not detectable in culture supernatants containing either starch alone or amylase alone. In contrast, the amount of AbpA was notably increased when starch and amylase were both present in the medium. The expression of abpA was significantly increased (P {$<$} 0.05) following 40 min of incubation in defined medium supplemented with starch and amylase. Similar results were obtained in the presence of maltose and other short-chain malto-oligosacchrides. These results suggest that the products of starch hydrolysis produced from the action of salivary {$\alpha$}-amylase, particularly maltose and maltotriose, up-regulate AbpA expression in S. gordonii.},

In general, preclinical and clinical data are unanimous in demonstrating that smokers present increased susceptibility, greater severity and faster progression of periodontal disease compared with nonsmokers. The evidence further demonstrates that smokers lose more teeth and have a less favorable response to therapy than do nonsmokers. Although it is well established that smoking significantly impacts on the onset, progression and outcome of periodontal disease, the mechanisms involved remain unclear. More importantly, some of the reported deleterious effects of smoking on periodontal tissues have been reported to be reversible upon participation in smoking-cessation programs. Therefore, clinicians should strongly advise smokers to enroll in cessation strategies, even temporarily, in order to improve the overall outcome.},

Modern imaging technology has brought about a revolution in the kinds of questions we can approach, but this comes at the price of increasingly complex equipment. Moreover, in an attempt to market competing systems, the microscopes have often been inappropriately described as easy to use and suitable for near-beginners. Insufficient understanding of the experimental manipulations and equipment set-up leads to the introduction of errors during image acquisition. In this feature, I review some of the most common practical pitfalls faced by researchers during image acquisition, and how they can affect the interpretation of the experimental data. This article is targeted neither to the microscopy gurus who push forward the frontiers of imaging technology nor to my imaging specialist colleagues who may wince at the overly simplistic comments and lack of detail. Instead, this is for beginners who gulp with alarm when they hear the word "confocal pinhole" or sigh as they watch their cells fade and die in front of their very eyes time and time again at the microscope. Take heart, beginners, if microscopes were actually so simple then many people (including myself) would suddenly be out of a job!},

In addition, Irish early medieval written sources testifying on child health during this period were consulted. These data were furthermore combined with the results of stable isotope analyses (nitrogen and carbon) conducted on subadult bone specimens. Cribra orbitalia was found in 27.5\% of the studied individuals (48.6\% of subadults were affected), with only two cases active at the time of death. The prevalence of LEH per individual is 63.5\% (78.9\% in subadults and 59.7\% in adults). The age ranges of LEH formation vary between 1.9 and 4.8 years for the maxillary teeth and between 1.8 and 6.2 years for the mandibular teeth. Periosteal inflammations were recorded in over one third of the studied subadults (36.2\%) with six cases active at the time of death. The stable isotope results suggest a diet based on terrestrial food sources, with little or no marine input. The presented data strongly suggest that most of the individuals were exposed to a high level of physiological stress during their childhood, and as such does not support the so called `osteological paradox' hypothesis. The observed disturbances were probably caused by a synergistic effect of various biological and socio-cultural factors. Although the historical records indicate certain differences in diet and lifestyle between social classes and the sexes, this study showed that the children of all ages had poor health in all social classes across a wide geographical location for the full time period of the early medieval.

  abstract = {Objective With the aim to get a better picture of dental health, diet and nutrition in early medieval Ireland a population-based study focusing on several attributes of oral health in adult individuals was conducted. The study focused on possible differences between sexes and age groups in terms of frequency and distribution of studied pathologies in order to determine whether these differences result from different diets, cultural practices or are age-related. Design Permanent dentitions belonging to adult individuals from five Irish early medieval sites were examined for the evidence of caries, ante-mortem tooth loss, abscesses, calculus, alveolar bone resorption and tooth wear. All pathologies were analysed and presented by teeth and alveoli. Results A total of 3233 teeth and 3649 alveoli belonging to 167 individuals (85 males and 82 females) were included into the analysis. Males exhibited significantly higher prevalence of abscesses, heavy wear and alveolar bone resorption, while females exhibited significantly higher prevalence of calculus. All studied dento-alveolar pathologies showed a strong correlation with advanced age, except calculus in females. Additionally, dental wear associated with habitual activities was observed in two females. Conclusion The results of the present study confirm the data gained by written sources and stable isotopes analyses suggesting the diet of the early Irish was rich in carbohydrates with only occasional use of meat. Furthermore, significant differences between the sexes in terms of recorded pathologies strongly suggest different nutritional patterns with females consuming foods mostly based on carbohydrates in comparison to males. The observed sex-differences might also occur due to differences between male and female sex such as reproductive biology and pregnancy, a somewhat different age distributions, but also as a result of different cultural practices between the sexes.},

A diaphysis of a long bone from a male individual with no morphological traces of tuberculosis was analysed. The bone was recovered from a 17th century man-of-war, situated in a layer of glacial mud in the Baltic Sea. Both osteological and X-ray diffraction analyses indicate that the bone is well preserved. The bone was analysed by amplifying DNA from a part of the repetitive element IS6110 of tuberculosis. Nested PCR was performed to increase the specificity and sensitivity. All the amplifications showed that there was DNA in the bone. This is consistent with the preservation of the material. By sequencing the DNA product, tuberculosis DNA was detected in accordance with previous studies. If the analysis procedure is refined, it will be possible to screen large amounts of bone material. This would thus provide more information on the distribution of the tuberculosis bacteria in the past. Copyright \textcopyright{} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}

However, recent studies indicate a need to reassess the interpretation of PCLs. This study addresses the potential health correlates of PCLs in a contemporary sample by examining relationships between the known cause of death (COD) and PCL presence/absence. Methods This study includes a sample of 461 juvenile individuals (6 months to 15 years of age) who underwent examination at the University of New Mexico's Office of the Medical Investigator between 2011 and 2019. The information available for each individual includes their sex, age at death, and their COD and manner of death. Results Odds ratio of having CO (OR = 3.92, p {$<$} .01) or PH (OR = 2.86, p = .02) lesions are increased in individuals with respiratory infections. Individuals with heart conditions have increased odds of having CO (OR = 3.52, p = .03) lesions, but not PH. Conclusion Individuals with respiratory infection are more likely to have CO and/or PH. CO appears to have a greater range of health correlates than PH does, as indicated by the heart condition results. However, individuals with congenital heart defects are at higher risk for respiratory infections, so bony alterations in cases of heart conditions may be due to respiratory illness. Since respiratory infection remains a leading cause of mortality today, CO and PH in bioarchaeological contexts should be considered as potential indicators of respiratory infections in the past.},

Colonization of the oral streptococci on the tooth surface depends on the adhesion of bacteria to salivary components adsorbed to the tooth surface. Recently, we identified unique cell surface long filamentous structures named pili in this species. Herein, we investigated the role of S. sanguinis pili in biofilm formation. We found that pili-deficient mutant, in which the genes encoding the three pilus proteins PilA, PilB and PilC have been deleted, showed an impaired bacterial accumulation on saliva-coated surfaces. Confocal microscopic observations suggested that the mutant was incapable of producing typical three-dimensional layer of biofilm. Ligand blot analysis showed that the ancillary pilus proteins PilB and PilC bound to human whole saliva. Additional analysis demonstrated that PilC bound to multiple salivary components, and one of which was found to be salivary a-amylase. These results indicate that pilus proteins are members of saliva-binding proteins of oral S. sanguinis, and suggest the involvement of pili in its colonization on saliva-coated tooth surfaces and in the human oral cavity.},

  abstract = {Relationships between geological phosphorite deposition and biological apatite nucleation have often been overlooked. However, similarities in biological apatite and phosphorite mineralogy suggest that their chemical formation mechanisms may be similar. This review serves to draw parallels between two newly described phosphorite mineralization processes, and proposes a similar novel mechanism for biologically controlled apatite mineral nucleation. This mechanism integrates polyphosphate biochemistry with crystal nucleation theory. Recently, the roles of polyphosphates in the nucleation of marine phosphorites were discovered. Marine bacteria and diatoms have been shown to store and concentrate inorganic phosphate (Pi) as amorphous, polyphosphate granules. Subsequent release of these P reserves into the local marine environment as Pi results in biologically induced phosphorite nucleation. Pi storage and release through an intracellular polyphosphate intermediate may also occur in mineralizing oral bacteria. Polyphosphates may be associated with biologically controlled apatite nucleation within vertebrates and invertebrates. Historically, biological apatite nucleation has been attributed to either a biochemical increase in local Pi concentration or matrix-mediated apatite nucleation control. This review proposes a mechanism that integrates both theories. Intracellular and extracellular amorphous granules, rich in both calcium and phosphorus, have been observed in apatite-biomineralizing vertebrates, protists, and atremate brachiopods. These granules may represent stores of calcium-polyphosphate. Not unlike phosphorite nucleation by bacteria and diatoms, polyphosphate depolymerization to Pi would be controlled by phosphatase activity. Enzymatic polyphosphate depolymerization would increase apatite saturation to the level required for mineral nucleation, while matrix proteins would simultaneously control the progression of new biological apatite formation.},

To date, however, studies of enamel thickness in humans, great apes, and their fossil relatives have focused on the permanent molar row. Comparatively little research effort has been devoted to tissue proportions within deciduous teeth. Here we attempt to fill this gap by documenting enamel thickness variation in the deciduous dentition of extant large-bodied hominoids. Materials and methods We used microcomputed tomography to image dental tissues in 80 maxillary and 78 mandibular deciduous premolars of Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla, and Pongo. Two-dimensional virtual sections were created from the image volumes to quantify average (AET) and relative (RET) enamel thickness, as well as its distribution across the crown. Results Our results reveal no significant differences in enamel thickness among the great apes. Unlike the pattern present in permanent molars, Pongo does not stand out as having relatively thicker-enameled deciduous premolars than P. troglodytes and Gorilla. Humans, on the other hand, possess significantly thicker deciduous premolar enamel in comparison to great apes. Following expectations from masticatory biomechanics, we also find that the ``functional'' side (protocone, protoconid) of deciduous premolars generally possesses thicker enamel than the ``nonfunctional'' side. Discussion Our study lends empirical support to anecdotal observations that patterns of AET and RET observed for permanent molars of large-bodied apes do not apply to deciduous premolars. By documenting enamel thickness variation in hominoid deciduous teeth, this study provides the comparative context to interpret rates and patterns of wear of deciduous teeth and their utility in life history reconstructions.},

  abstract = {Rickets and osteomalacia are the subadult and adult expressions of a disease in which the underlying problem is a failure to mineralize bone protein (osteoid). The most common cause of this disease is a physiological deficiency in vitamin D. The associated problems include deformed bones and this condition is well known in pre-modern medical texts and documents as a fairly common cause of morbidity. Given these facts, it is surprising that the literature on palaeopathology provides very little evidence of this disease in archaeological human skeletal samples. The medieval sample (N=687) of human remains from Wharram Percy, North Yorkshire, England contains a remarkable subsample of eight burials in which a spectrum of pathological features is expressed. The subsample includes infants ranging in age from 3 to 18 months at the time of death. Ten abnormal bone features were identified in the subsample, including: (i) cranial vault porosity; (ii) orbital roof porosity; (iii) deformation of the mandibular ramus; (iv) deformation of arm bones; (v) deformation of leg bones; (vi) flared costo-chondral ends of ribs; (vii) irregular and porous cortex of the costo-chondral ends of the ribs; (viii) abnormality of the growth plates of long bones; (ix) irregular and porous surfaces of the metaphyseal cortex; (x) thickening of the long bones, particularly in the metaphyseal areas. Not all of these features were found in all of the cases. Nevertheless, the overall pattern of skeletal abnormality fits well with the anatomical and radiological conditions associated with rickets. \textcopyright{} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}

While reproducibility is core to our definition, most data science learners enter the field with other aspects of data science in mind, for example predictive modelling, which is often one of the most interesting topics to novices. This fact, along with the highly technical nature of the industry standard reproducibility tools currently employed in data science, present out-of-the gate challenges in teaching reproducibility in the data science classroom. Put simply, students are not as intrinsically motivated to learn this topic, and it is not an easy one for them to learn. What can a data science educator do? Over several iterations of teaching courses focused on reproducible data science tools and workflows, we have found that providing extra motivation, guided instruction and lots of practice are key to effectively teaching this challenging, yet important subject. Here we present examples of how we motivate, guide, and provide ample practice opportunities to data science students to effectively engage them in learning about this topic.},

The essential oils showed greater efficacy than the powdered plant extracts, where thyme and lemongrass oils were the most potent. Also, the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum fungicidal concentration of these oils were determined. Furthermore, their chemical components were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. In vivo, studies were performed using biodeteriorated samples for applying treatment, in which the microbiological test revealed that both oils can eradicate both tested fungi completely after exposure time, ranging from two weeks for papyrus samples to 14 weeks for linen. A scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and colorimeter were used to assess the treatment process, leading to the final results, which suggest that the essential oils could be useful sources of fungicidal preparations for the disinfection of biodeteriorated linen and papyrus artefacts. Nevertheless, further studies are strongly recommended to introduce these sources into practical use in preventive conservation.},

Research results show that asymmetry in our body, skull, and jaws is often related to genetic, epigenetic, environmental and individual ontogenetic factors. Our study aims to provide evidence for a significant link between masticatory asymmetry and occlusal contact between antagonist teeth by testing the hypothesis that tooth inclination is one of the mechanisms driving distribution of wear in masticatory phases in addition to dietary and cultural habits. The present work investigates the relationship between dental macrowear patterns and tooth inclinations on a sample of complete maxillary and mandibular 3D models of dental arches from 19 young and adult Yuendumu Aboriginal individuals. The analysis was carried out on first molars (M1) from all quadrants. Occlusal Fingerprint Analysis was used for the quantification of macrowear patterns, and 2D cross-sectional geometric analysis was carried out to investigate asymmetry in dental arches. The asymmetry is highly variable on both arches, and it is associated with differences in the inclination of upper M1 crowns. Each molar has variable inclination (buccal/lingual) which influence tooth to tooth contact, producing greater or lesser variation in wear pattern. Interindividual variability of morphological variation of the occlusal relationship has to be considered in macrowear analysis. Our results suggest that overall asymmetry in the masticatory apparatus in modern humans affects occlusal contact areas between antagonist teeth influencing macrowear and chewing efficiency during ontogeny.}

Evidence of the natural history and progression of the disease is now primarily studied through the observation and analysis of osteoarcheological specimens, and medical reports or books dating from the pre-antibiotic era. This report illustrates several cases where modern medical imaging techniques and ancient medical literature were successfully interpreted to diagnose rare, advanced-stage tuberculous alterations in osteoarcheological specimens. Two skeletons from the B\'atmonostor cemetery (Hungary) demonstrate complete unilateral ankylosis of the knee. Macroscopic and radiographic examinations were undertaken to assess the extent of skeletal changes and determine their cause. Data obtained from computed tomography (CT) were constructed in 2D and 3D. The 2D CT images revealed cavities involving both the metaphyses and the epiphyses. The 3D reconstructions allowed us to reconstruct the more precise volumetric morphology of the circumscribed lytic lesions, as well as clear `image-mirror' lacunar volumes. On the basis of the macroscopic and radiological analyses, extra-spinal tuberculous infection seems to have been the most probable etiology of these two cases.

  abstract = {The first objective of this study is to reconstruct levels and types of physical activity and associated sexual and social differences using human skeletal remains from the predominately 19th century Dutch cemetery of Middenbeemster. For most individuals, life in the Beemster centred around dairy farming and was heavily based on manual labor, with a purported higher class of wealthier individuals performing less manual labor. Two skeletal markers of activity are examined in the upper limb of late young adult and middle-aged adults of both sexes (26\textendash 49\,years, n\,=\,69): osteoarthritis (OA) and entheseal changes (EC). Results support the hypothesis that the majority of the population engaged in high levels of physical activity; however, a group with a clearly lower or different pattern of activity, possibly representing a higher, less active class, was not discernible. This may be due to a low number of less active individuals in the analysed sample and/or the heterogeneity of occupations and activities. A gendered division of labour was evident in the EC data with males having more pronounced muscle attachments in almost all sites, especially the biceps brachii, used primarily in lifting. Females had more pronounced triceps brachii, which may be due to activities that required pushing or pulling with the elbow in a flexed position. The prevalence and severity of OA did not differ between the sexes. While this could be interpreted to indicate men and women engaged in a similar level of strenuous activity, hormonal and anatomical differences limit the strength of the comparison. The second objective of this study is to evaluate the concordance of OA and EC as activity markers. The correlation between OA and EC is very low, illustrating their variable and complex etiologies. Etiological factors need further research for OA and EC to become more reliable activity markers. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}

These observations have led to the hypothesis that interbacterial adhesion influences spatiotemporal development of plaque. To assess the role of such interactions in oral biofilm formation in vivo, antibodies directed against bacterial surface components that mediate coaggregation interactions were used as direct immunofluorescent probes in conjunction with laser confocal microscopy to determine the distribution and spatial arrangement of bacteria within intact human plaque formed on retrievable enamel chips. In intrageneric coaggregation, streptococci such as Streptococcus gordonii DL1 recognize receptor polysaccharides (RPS) borne on other streptococci such as Streptococcus oralis 34. To define potentially interactive subsets of streptococci in the developing plaque, an antibody against RPS (anti-RPS) was used together with an antibody against S. gordonii DL1 (anti-DL1). These antibodies reacted primarily with single cells in 4-h-old plaque and with mixed-species microcolonies in 8-h-old plaque. Anti-RPS-reactive bacteria frequently formed microcolonies with anti-DL1-reactive bacteria and with other bacteria distinguished by general nucleic acid stains. In intergeneric coaggregation between streptococci and actinomyces, type 2 fimbriae of actinomyces recognize RPS on the streptococci. Cells reactive with antibody against type 2 fimbriae of Actinomyces naeslundii T14V (anti-type-2) were much less frequent than either subset of streptococci. However, bacteria reactive with anti-type-2 were seen in intimate association with anti-RPS-reactive cells. These results are the first direct demonstration of coaggregation-mediated interactions during initial plaque accumulation in vivo. Further, these results demonstrate the spatiotemporal development and prevalence of mixed-species communities in early dental plaque.},

Recently, human dental calculus has received much attention for its well-preserved proteomes locked in mineralized dental plaque which stores information on human diets and the oral microbiome otherwise invisible to other biomolecular approaches. Maximizing proteome recovery in ancient dental calculus, available only in minute quantities and irreplaceable after destructive analysis, is of paramount importance. Here, we compare the more traditional ultrafiltration-based and acetone precipitation approaches with the newer paramagnetic bead approach in order to test the influence of demineralization acid on recovered proteome complexity obtained from specimens as well as the sequence coverages matched for significant proteins. We found that a protocol utilizing EDTA combined with paramagnetic beads increased proteome complexity, in some cases doubling the number of unique peptides and number of proteins matched, compared to protocols involving the use of HCl and either acetone precipitation or ultrafiltration. Although the increase in the number of proteins was almost exclusively of bacterial origin, a development that has implications for the study of diseases within these ancient populations, an increase in the peptide number for the dairy proteins {$\beta$}-lactoglobulin and casein was also observed reflecting an increase in sequence coverage for these dietary proteins of interest. We also consider structural explanations for the discrepancies observed between these two key dietary proteins preserved in archaeological dental calculus.}

  abstract = {Specific interbacterial adhesion, termed coaggregation, is well established for three early colonizers of the plaque biofilm: streptococci, actinomyces, and veillonellae. However, little is known about interactions of other early colonizers and about the extent of interactions within the bacterial community from a single host. To address these gaps, subject-specific culture collections from two individuals were established using an intraoral biofilm retrieval device. Molecular taxonomy (Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray [HOMIM]) analysis of biofilm samples confirmed the integrity and completeness of the collections. HOMIM analysis verified the isolation of Streptococcus gordonii and S. anginosus from only one subject, as well as isolation of a previously uncultivated streptococcal phylotype from the other subject. Strains representative of clonal diversity within each collection were further characterized. Greater than 70\% of these streptococcal strains from each subject coaggregated with at least one other coisolate. One-third of the strains carry a known coaggregation mediator: receptor polysaccharide (RPS). Almost all nonstreptococcal isolates coaggregated with other coisolates. Importantly, certain Rothia strains demonstrated more coaggregations with their coisolated bacteria than did any Streptococcus or Actinomyces strain, and certain Haemophilus isolates participated in twice as many. Confocal microscopy of undisturbed biofilms showed that Rothia and Haemophilus each occur in small multispecies microcolonies. However, in confluent high-biomass regions, Rothia occurred in islands whereas Haemophilus was distributed throughout. Together, the data demonstrate that coaggregation networks within an individual's oral microflora are extensive and that Rothia and Haemophilus can be important initiators of cell-cell interactions in the early biofilm., IMPORTANCE Extensive involvement of specific interbacterial adhesion in dental plaque biofilm formation has been postulated based on in vitro coaggregation between oral bacteria from culture collections that are not subject specific. In the present study, subject-specific culture collections were obtained from early plaque biofilm of two volunteers, and coaggregations within each culture collection were assayed. Coaggregations, several of which involved a coaggregation-mediating cell surface molecule known from well-studied streptococci, were widespread. Unexpectedly, the little-studied organisms Haemophilus and Rothia participated in the greatest numbers of interactions with community members; these two organisms showed different distributions within the undisturbed biofilm. The data show that coaggregation networks encompass most organisms within the biofilm community of each individual, and they indicate prominent participation of organisms such as Haemophilus and Rothia in early plaque biofilm formation.},

The need for reliable methods distinguishing males from females based upon various skeletal elements is evident in cases of commingled, eroded and/or missing remains. The aim of this work lays on establishing criteria for sex estimation from the scapula and the clavicle in modern Greeks. A total of 147 left scapulae and 147 clavicles (66 females and 81 males) were used in the study. Eight and six measurements were taken on the scapula and clavicle respectively and data were subjected to principal components analysis (PCA) and discriminant function analysis (DFA). Posterior probabilities for the classification of each individual are also calculated. Statistical analysis was carried out using the software PAST (Paleontological Statistics) and SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) 18. The results supported the existence of pronounced sexual dimorphism, which was mainly attributed to size differences among the two groups. Univariate and multivariate methods of statistical classification showed high accuracy for all scapular and most clavicular measurements, verifying their value as sex indicators in the under study population. We recommend the use of this method for sex assessment from the scapula and the clavicle in cases exhibiting over 95\% probability of correct classification. This is regardless of the overall high degree of accuracy reported here, as the method of choice in forensic contexts should always be case-driven.},

In the classical context of this problem, standards produced by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are used in chemical, mechanical, electrical, and materials-engineering analyses. Often, applications cast into this calibration framework do not provide ?gold standards? such as the standards provided by NIST. This paper considers the classical calibration approach, in which the experiment treats the standards as the regressor and the observed values as the response to calibrate the instrument. The analyst then must invert the resulting regression model in order to use the instrument to make actual measurements in practice. This paper compares this classical approach to inverse regression, which treats the standards as the response and the observed measurements as the regressor in the calibration experiment. Such an approach is intuitively appealing because it is simple and easily implemented in most software. However, it violates some of the basic regression assumptions. In this paper, we study the properties of classical and inverse regression applied to calibration problems, compare their performance, and provide guidance to practitioners.}

Amelogenin proteins, AMELX\_HUMAN and AMELY\_HUMAN, are expressed in the tooth organ and play a major role in mineralization of enamel, the most taphonomically resistant, archaeologically persistent human tissue. We describe shotgun liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis of 40 enamel samples representing 25 individuals, including modern third molars and archaeological teeth from open-air contexts including permanent adult (400 to 7300 BP) and deciduous teeth (100 to 1000 BP). Peptides specific to the X-chromosome isoform of amelogenin were detected in all samples. Peptides specific to the sexually dimorphic Y-chromosome isoform were also detected in 26 samples from 13 individuals, across all time periods, including previously unsexed deciduous teeth from archaeological contexts. While the signal of each gene product can vary by more than an order of magnitude, we show close agreement between osteological and amelogenin-based sex estimation and thus demonstrate that the protein-based signal can be obtained reliably from open-air archaeological contexts dating to at least 7300 years ago. While samples with AMELY\_HUMAN peptides are unambiguously male, samples with no AMELY\_HUMAN signal may either be low signal male false negative samples or female samples. In order to estimate sex in these samples we developed a probability curve of female sex as a function of the logarithm of AMELX\_HUMAN signal (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001) using logistic regression. This is also the first demonstration using proteomics to estimate sex in deciduous teeth and pushes back the application of the method to teeth that are at least 7300 years old.},

  abstract = {Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) are commonly abused by adolescents with reported past year (2013) use in high school students between 3 and 10\%. Standard adolescent postmortem toxicology does not include routine SC analysis, and thus, the true burden of fatalities related to SCs is unknown. A retrospective case review of two cases included scene investigation, interviews, autopsy, and toxicology. SCs were confirmed by liquid chromatography\textendash tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Review of the eight adolescent SC-associated fatalities in the literature revealed five of eight cases had no other discernible cause of death on autopsy. Compounds detected included PB-22 (1.1 ng/mL), JWH-210 (12 ng/mL), XLR-11 (1.3 ng/mL), JWH-122, AB-CHMINACA (8.2 ng/mL), UR-144 (12.3 ng/mL), and JWH-022 (3 ng/mL). With synthetic drug use on the rise, forensic experts should have a high index of suspicion for the possibility of SC intoxication in adolescent fatalities with no other discernible cause of death.}

However, in forensic cases where skeletal remains often exhibit postmortem damage and taphonomic changes the patella may be used for the estimation of sex as it is a preservationally favoured bone. The goal of the present research was to derive discriminant function equations from the patella for estimation of sex from an historic African American population. Six parameters were measured on 200 individuals (100 males and 100 females), ranging in age from 20 to 80 years old, from the Robert J. Terry Anatomical Skeleton Collection. The statistical analyses showed that all variables were sexually dimorphic. Discriminant function score equations were generated for use in sex estimation. The overall accuracy of sex classification ranged from 80.0\% to 85.0\% for the direct method and 80.0\%-84.5\% for the stepwise method. Overall, when the Spanish and Black South African discriminant functions were applied to the African American population they showed low accuracy rates for sexing the African American sample. However, when the White South African discriminant functions were applied to the African American sample they displayed high accuracy rates for sexing the African American population. The patella was shown to be accurate for sex estimation in the historic African American population.},

The most prevalent and consequential oral diseases globally are dental caries (tooth decay), periodontal disease, tooth loss, and cancers of the lips and oral cavity. In this first of two papers in a Series on oral health, we describe the scope of the global oral disease epidemic, its origins in terms of social and commercial determinants, and its costs in terms of population wellbeing and societal impact. Although oral diseases are largely preventable, they persist with high prevalence, reflecting widespread social and economic inequalities and inadequate funding for prevention and treatment, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). As with most non-communicable diseases (NCDs), oral conditions are chronic and strongly socially patterned. Children living in poverty, socially marginalised groups, and older people are the most affected by oral diseases, and have poor access to dental care. In many LMICs, oral diseases remain largely untreated because the treatment costs exceed available resources. The personal consequences of chronic untreated oral diseases are often severe and can include unremitting pain, sepsis, reduced quality of life, lost school days, disruption to family life, and decreased work productivity. The costs of treating oral diseases impose large economic burdens to families and health-care systems. Oral diseases are undoubtedly a global public health problem, with particular concern over their rising prevalence in many LMICs linked to wider social, economic, and commercial changes. By describing the extent and consequences of oral diseases, their social and commercial determinants, and their ongoing neglect in global health policy, we aim to highlight the urgent need to address oral diseases among other NCDs as a global health priority.},

  abstract = {The study of entheseal changes (ECs), that is, osseous changes that occur at muscle attachment sites, has increased in recent years because they have been considered one of the most promising markers of activity in the human skeleton. Their aetiology is highly questioned because several factors unrelated to mechanical stress may be involved in their occurrence. Here, we test the validity of some methods created on different bases for the study of ECs to try to make an approach towards the most beneficial aspects of each method. Seven upper limbs' fibrocartilaginous entheses from a sample of 60 adult medieval individuals have been analysed employing three methods: Villotte (2006), Santana (2011) and the so-called New Coimbra method (Henderson et al., 2016; Henderson, Mariotti, et al., 2013). These three methods have been applied on the same skeletons. The results show that the three methods seem to indicate the same general trends but with different intensity and some nuances. Santana's method always provides the most frequencies of presence and the highest scores of ECs. In turn, the Coimbra method finds the fewest scores and frequencies of ECs probably because its criteria are the most specific of the three methods. Villotte's method seems to be the one that determines the general tendencies of ECs in the clearest way. This is also evidenced by the calculated Kappa coefficients: the highest agreement is detected between Villotte's lowest scores and Santana's highest ones (k = 0.743); the moderate agreement (k = 0.596; k = 0.544) recorded between Villotte's highest scores and Coimbra's lowest indicates that the latest one registers the lowest scores of ECs between the analysed three methods. All this points to a methodological consensus that should be based on current anatomical knowledge, criteria that are intuitive and flexible, and the use of many scores of osseous expression to avoid excessive sample fragmentation.},

In nonhuman primates, this latter function is poorly understood, or even claimed to be absent. In this observational study, we documented interactions between chimpanzees and zoo visitors and found that the two species imitated each other at a similar rate, corresponding to almost 10\% of all produced actions. Imitation appeared to accomplish a social\textendash communicative function, as cross-species interactions that contained imitative actions lasted significantly longer than interactions without imitation. In both species, physical proximity promoted cross-species imitation. Overall, imitative precision was higher among visitors than among chimpanzees, but this difference vanished in proximity contexts, i.e. in the indoor environment. Four of five chimpanzees produced imitations; three of them exhibited comparable imitation rates, despite large individual differences in level of cross-species interactivity. We also found that chimpanzees evidenced imitation recognition, yet only when visitors imitated their actions (as opposed to postures). Imitation recognition was expressed by returned imitation in 36\% of the cases, and all four imitating chimpanzees engaged in so-called imitative games. Previously regarded as unique to early human socialization, such games serve to maintain social engagement. The results presented here indicate that nonhuman apes exhibit spontaneous imitation that can accomplish a communicative function. The study raises a number of novel questions for imitation research and highlights the imitation of familiar behaviours as a relevant\textemdash yet thus far understudied\textemdash research topic.},

The importance of microbial film and its complexity as an ecosystem make it a most interesting area for ecological study. This very complexity makes in situ investigation extremely difficult, suggesting that laboratory model systems are needed if the fundamental processes of microbial film are to be understood. The constant-depth film fermenter maintains a steady-state by physically removing growth once a predetermined depth of film has been generated. A variety of surfaces may become colonized by microbial film, and characteristic properties of a given film may be determined by the nature of the substratum material. Microbial films are responsible for so much economic damage that a brief discussion of economic applications of film fermenters seems important. The resulting microbial film is a complex heterogeneous ecosystem with bacteria held in a matrix of polymeric substances produced by one or more of the species involved.},

However, dispersion is only one of many ways to escape the biofilm mode of growth. The present review is aimed at distinguishing this active and regulated process of dispersion from the passive processes of desorption and detachment by highlighting the regulatory processes and distinct phenotypes specific to dispersed cells.},

Intestinal contents were recovered from the Piraino 1 mummy from the ``Sepulcher of the Priests'', Piraino Mother Church, in the province of Messina, Sicily. Using standard palynological methods and pollen concentration technique, we quantified the numbers of pollen grains per gram of coprolite. The pollen spectrum was dominated by Polygalaceae, the Milkwort Family. Polygalaceae pollen is rarely found in archaeological sites. Based on comparison to published keys, we determined that the pollen came from a species of Polygala. Polygala contains species with medicinal value. We found nine other pollen types. Traces of Potamogeton (pondweed) was observed in preliminary scans. Multiple grains of Brassicaceae (mustard family), cereal (cultivated grains), Typha (cattail) and Cheno-am were found. Single grains of Castanea (chestnut), Fabaceae (bean family), Salix (willow), and Solanaceae (tomato family) were found. The preservation of the pollen was poor except for Polygala and the cereal pollen. Brassicaceae and Cheno-am have been part of the natural pollen spectrum in Sicily since ancient times. Cereal grains were consumed with prepared food. Importantly, background arboreal pollen was nearly absent. This indicates that Piraino 1 died during months of low pollination. The absence of olive pollen is important since this plant in Sicily reaches its maximum pollination in May and June and tapers off rapidly by mid-June. Therefore, absence of the key warm season airborne pollen type suggests a post-June death. Macrofossils, especially residue from grape pulp, indicates a death in September to November. His cause of death was likely a result of multiple myeloma. The methodological differences between archaeopalynology and forensic palynology are summarized. We suggest that the palynological methods presented here should be adopted for human remains analysis in forensic palynology.},

We report here an examination of starch grains preserved in the calculus of human teeth from these sites that provides direct evidence for the early consumption of cultivated squash and peanuts along with two other major food plants not previously detected. Starch from the seeds of Phaseolus and Inga feuillei, the flesh of Cucurbita moschata fruits, and the nuts of Arachis was routinely present on numerous teeth that date to between 8210 and 6970 14C yr B.P. Early plant diets appear to have been diverse and stable through time and were rich in cultivated foods typical of later Andean agriculture. Our data provide early archaeological evidence for Phaseolus beans and I. feuillei, an important tree crop, and indicate that effective food production systems that contributed significant dietary inputs were present in the \~Nanchoc region by 8000 14C yr B.P. Starch grain studies of dental remains document plants and edible parts of them not normally preserved in archaeological records and can assume primary roles as direct indicators of ancient human diets and agriculture.}

In order to evaluate the performance of various ordinal classifiers one needs both artificially generated as well as real world data sets. Two algorithms are presented for generating monotone ordinal data sets. The first can be used for generating random monotone ordinal data sets without an underlying structure. The second algorithm, which is the main contribution of this paper, describes for the first time how structured monotone data sets can be generated.},

Few studies to date have directly compared the microremain record from dental calculus to dietary records, and none with long-term observation dietary records, thus limiting how we can interpret diet, food acquisition and behaviour. Here we present a high-resolution analysis of calculus microremains from wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) of Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire. We test microremain assemblages against more than two decades of field behavioural observations to establish the ability of calculus to capture the composition of diet. Our results show that some microremain classes accumulate as long-lived dietary markers. Phytolith abundance in calculus can reflect the proportions of plants in the diet, yet this pattern is not true for starches. We also report microremains can record information about other dietary behaviours, such as the age of weaning and learned food processing techniques like nut-cracking.},

The dental calculus of contemporary human and non-human populations with known diets have been used as reference datasets, including the chimpanzees of Ta\"i National Park (C\^ote d'Ivoire), but explaining the preservation mechanism involved is challenged by our incomplete knowledge of the microremain content within the diets of these reference populations and our rudimentary information on microremain incorporation into dental calculus. Here, we analyse phytoliths in faecal samples to assess to what extent plant phytoliths of a diet are reflected in the dental calculus as well as in the egested faeces. In this study, we identify and document the faecal phytolith assemblages as an indicator of plant consumption in two Western chimpanzees of the Ta\"i National Park (C\^ote d'Ivoire) before (wet season), during (dry season) and after (dry season) a dust-rich period. Moreover, observational dietary records of these two individuals were compiled to improve the interpretability of this dental calculus phytolith dataset. The faecal phytolith assemblages vary significantly across samples in terms of abundance and diversity. The most common phytolith morphotypes were eudicot plates, single-cell and multi-cell tracheids, monocot rugulose and echinate spheroids and, to a lesser extent, unspecified thick and thin elongates. High loads of grit and other micro-remains (e.g. diatoms) are found during the dry period. Using observational dietary records as a starting point and our faecal results as a terminus, we consider how dental calculus can accumulate phytoliths. Our findings enable identification of the phytolith morphotypes that are under-represented in dental calculus, which is highly informative for future dental calculus research strategies.},

Currently, the analytical techniques used to visualize the internal structure of human dental calculus and entrapped inclusions are limited and require destructive sampling, which cannot always be justified. Approach: We used propagation phase-contrast synchrotron radiation micro-computed tomography (PPC-SR-{$\mu$}CT) to non-destructively examine the internal organization of dental calculus, including its microstructure and entrapped inclusions, on both modern and archeological samples. Results: The virtual histological exploration of the samples shows that PPC-SR-{$\mu$}CT is a powerful approach to visualize the internal organization of dental calculus. We identified several important features, including previously undetected negative imprints of enamel and dentine growth markers (perikymata and periradicular bands, respectively), the non-contiguous structure of calculus layers with multiple voids, and entrapped plant remains. Conclusions: PPC-SR-{$\mu$}CT is an effective technique to explore dental calculus structural organization, and is especially powerful for enabling the identification of inclusions. The non-destructive nature of synchrotron tomography helps protect samples for future research. However, the irregular layers and frequent voids reveal a high heterogeneity and variability within calculus, with implications for research focusing on inclusions.}

There was little difference in the final cell density (5 \texttimes{} 104 cfu mm-2) of the Strep. sanguis biofilm on the three substrata. When hydroxyapatite-grown biofilms were exposed to the mouthwashes for 1 min, the one containing triclosan (T) proved the most effective. The chlorhexidine-containing mouthwash (CX) also achieved significant kills. The T-containing mouthwash was the most effective at killing biofilms grown on enamel. Pre-treatment of hydroxyapatite with CX, cetylpyridium chloride (CPC) or T for 1 min resulted in undetectable biofilm formation after 8 h. After 8 h of growth, only biofilms grown on enamel discs pre-treated with CX showed a reduction in the number of viable organisms. In conclusion, the results of this study have shown that while growth of Strep. sanguis on hydroxyapatite and enamel were similar, the ability of antimicrobial agents to prevent the accumulation of viable bacteria depended on the nature of the substratum.},

In most discriminant analysis applications, however, at least one variable is qualitative (ruling out multivariate normality).

The content of organic material in calculus is decreased by {$\sim$}75\% compared with modern calculus, resulting in diagenetic changes to {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N of organic matter. Neither {$\delta$}13C nor {$\delta$}15N analyses of the organic component of calculus provide accurate estimates of paleodiet. Although {$\delta$}15N values of dental calculus are correlated with {$\delta$}15N values of bone collagen from the same individual, it is clear that they have been greatly affected by diagenesis, as shown by a correlation between C/N ratio and {$\delta$}15N. The inorganic (mineral-bound) carbon component of calculus, analyzed separately from the organic component, gave {$\delta$}13C values slightly offset from {$\delta$}13C values of CO3 in bone mineral.

  abstract = {Saliva in the mouth is a biofluid produced mainly by three pairs of major salivary glands \textendash{} the submandibular, parotid and sublingual glands \textendash{} along with secretions from many minor submucosal salivary glands. Salivary gland secretion is a nerve-mediated reflex and the volume of saliva secreted is dependent on the intensity and type of taste and on chemosensory, masticatory or tactile stimulation. Long periods of low (resting or unstimulated) flow are broken by short periods of high flow, which is stimulated by taste and mastication. The nerve-mediated salivary reflex is modulated by nerve signals from other centers in the central nervous system, which is most obvious as hyposalivation at times of anxiety. An example of other neurohormonal influences on the salivary reflex is the circadian rhythm, which affects salivary flow and ionic composition. Cholinergic parasympathetic and adrenergic sympathetic autonomic nerves evoke salivary secretion, signaling through muscarinic M3 and adrenoceptors on salivary acinar cells and leading to secretion of fluid and salivary proteins. Saliva gland acinar cells are chloride and sodium secreting, and the isotonic fluid produced is rendered hypotonic by salivary gland duct cells as it flows to the mouth. The major proteins present in saliva are secreted by salivary glands, creating viscoelasticity and enabling the coating of oral surfaces with saliva. Salivary films are essential for maintaining oral health and regulating the oral microbiome. Saliva in the mouth contains a range of validated and potential disease biomarkers derived from epithelial cells, neutrophils, the microbiome, gingival crevicular fluid and serum. For example, cortisol levels are used in the assessment of stress, matrix metalloproteinases-8 and -9 appear to be promising markers of caries and periodontal disease, and a panel of mRNA and proteins has been proposed as a marker of oral squamous cell carcinoma. Understanding the mechanisms by which components enter saliva is an important aspect of validating their use as biomarkers of health and disease.},

Both {$\delta$}15N and {$\delta$}13C data clearly show the trophic level effect associated with breastfeeding. Childhood diet is investigated using dental pathology data in the deciduous dentitions of 78 individuals aged between 1 and 12 years. The presence of calculus, caries, and tooth wear in young children suggests that individuals were provided complementary foods and other items that impacted their dental health at an early age. The isotopic and dental data are generally consistent with the historical evidence from the Roman period with respect to the general timetable of weaning and the character of complementary foods.

However, while most of the material described in published works does represent food, dental calculus is in fact a "depositional environment" as material can enter the mouth from a range of sources. In this respect, it therefore represents an archaeological deposit that can also contain extensive non-dietary debris. This can comprise a wide variety of cultural and environmental material which reaches the mouth and can become embedded in dental calculus through alternative pathways. Here, we explore the human behaviors and activities besides eating that can generate a flux of particles into the human mouth, the broad range of additional cultural and environmental information that can be obtained through the analysis and contextualisation of this material, and the implications of the additional pathways by which material can become embedded in dental calculus.},

Here we present the first scientific study carried out to elucidate the use of Mediterranean imports in Early Celtic Central Europe and their local ceramic counterparts through organic residue analyses of 99 vessels from Vix-Mont Lassois, a key Early Celtic site. In the Mediterranean imports we identified imported plant oils and grape wine, and evidence points towards appropriation of these foreign vessels. Both Greek and local wares served for drinking grape wine and other plant-based fermented beverage(s). A wide variety of animal and plant by-products (e.g. fats, oils, waxes, resin) were also identified. Using an integrative approach, we show the importance of beehive products, millet and bacteriohopanoid beverage(s) in Early Celtic drinking practices. We highlight activities related to biomaterial transformation and show intra-site and status-related differences in consumption practices and/ or beverage processing.},

  abstract = {While double-zonal osteons (DZ) are characterized by a hyper-mineralized ring inside their lamellae, recent findings suggest that this ring is also defined by a change in the collagen fibers' orientation. Collagen and minerals are essential components to the maintenance of adequate bone strength and their alteration can modify the mechanical properties of the bone tissue. Consequently, the aim of this study is to explore the effect of past loads, as estimated from cross-sectional geometric properties, on the formation of DZ osteons compared to type I (common) osteons. The sample consists of paired humerus and femur midshaft sections (n = 23) of Eurocanadian settlers from the historical St. Matthew cemetery, Quebec City (1771\textendash 1860). Histomorphometric variables included in this study are osteon density for DZ and type I osteons (DZD; OPD), osteon area (DZOn.Ar; On. Ar), Haversian canal area (DZH.Ar; H.Ar), and the area within the hypermineralized ring (HR. Ar). Loading history is estimated from cross-sectional properties including the following variable: cortical and total area (CA, TA), maximum and minimum second moment of area (Imax, Imin) and polar moment of area (J). When the humerus and femur of the same individuals are compared, the femur has a higher OPD, DZD, and relative DZD (DZD/OPD). DZ osteons have a smaller area and Haversian canal area compared to type I osteons. The area within the hypermineralized ring in DZ is higher than the Haversian canal area of the type I osteons. Correlations between the residual scores of the regression of histomorphometric variables and cross-sectional properties of the humerus on the femur were not significant. Based on the analysis of the entire cross-section, the lack of correlation between variations in cross-sectional properties and remodeling combined with the significant differences between humeri and femura suggests that the creation of DZ or type I osteons in the bone tissue might be due to a bone specific response, possibly related to differences in bone tissue age that needs to be further investigated. Definitive conclusion regarding biomechanical loads still seem to be premature as regional variations associated with mechanical properties remain to be explored.}

Methods Six volunteers participated in the study. Impression of maxillary arch was taken for each patient, and a removable orthodontic appliance with a custom-made retainer was fabricated. Clean Ge crystals mounted in the retainers were placed intraorally for 30min, 8, 24h and 1-week period. The free sampling surface of another series of Ge crystals was treated with the commercial CPP\textendash ACP agent (Tooth Mousse), mounted in the retainers and placed intraorally for the same period as above. The free exposed surfaces in oral cavity of the specimens in all subjects were examined as follows: (a) reflected light microscopy, (b) micro-MIR-FTIR spectroscopy and (c) scanning electron microscopy (SEM) plus energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis analysis (XEDS). Results The light microscopic observations revealed that there was a delay in biofilm formation on Ge surfaces treated with agent in comparison to those ones without treatment. The micro-MIR-FTIR spectra from the surfaces with Tooth Mousse showed an increase in intensity and a left shift of PO43- peak (1064cm-1). Finally, the PO43- peak at lower bands (564cm-1) and the low-wave bands at 525\textendash 530cm-1 increased at 1-week interval. The SEM revealed the dendritic development of microbes. The XEDS analysis showed a significant increase in Cl/O, K/O, K/Cl and a decrease in Ca/O and P/O ratios on the crystal Ge without surface treatment. On contrary, on the crystal Ge with surface treatment an increase in Ca/O, Ca/P and a decrease in K/Cl ratios were found. Conclusion The results show that the presence of CPP\textendash ACP agent delays the biofilm formation and favored the nucleation and crystallization of calcium phosphates, possibly in apatitic form, in matured biofilms.},

S. mutans binds to  saliva-coated tooth surfaces, and previous studies suggested that  fimbriae may play a role in the initial bacterial adherence to salivary  components. The objectives of this study were to establish the ability  of an S. mutans fimbria preparation to bind to  saliva-coated surfaces and determine the specific salivary components  that facilitate binding with fimbriae. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay (ELISA) established that the S. mutans fimbria  preparation bound to components of whole saliva. Sodium dodecyl  sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot  techniques were used to separate components of whole saliva and  determine fimbria binding. SDS-PAGE separated 15 major protein bands  from saliva samples, and Western blot analysis indicated significant  binding of the S. mutans fimbria preparation to a 52-kDa  salivary protein. The major fimbria-binding salivary protein was  isolated by preparative electrophoresis. The ability of the S.  mutans fimbria preparation to bind to the purified salivary  protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis and ELISA. Incubation of  the purified salivary protein with the S. mutans fimbria  preparation significantly neutralized binding of the salivary  protein-fimbria complex to saliva-coated surfaces. The salivary  protein, whole saliva, and commercial amylase reacted similarly with  antiamylase antibody in immunoblots. A purified 65-kDa fimbrial protein  was demonstrated to bind to both saliva and amylase. These data  indicated that the S. mutans fimbria preparation and a  purified fimbrial protein bound to whole-saliva-coated surfaces and  that amylase is the major salivary component involved in the binding.},

  abstract = {Skip to Next Section Crocodilians are among the most vocal non-avian reptiles. Adults of both sexes produce loud vocalizations known as `bellows' year round, with the highest rate during the mating season. Although the specific function of these vocalizations remains unclear, they may advertise the caller's body size, because relative size differences strongly affect courtship and territorial behaviour in crocodilians. In mammals and birds, a common mechanism for producing honest acoustic signals of body size is via formant frequencies (vocal tract resonances). To our knowledge, formants have to date never been documented in any non-avian reptile, and formants do not seem to play a role in the vocalizations of anurans. We tested for formants in crocodilian vocalizations by using playbacks to induce a female Chinese alligator (Alligator sinensis) to bellow in an airtight chamber. During vocalizations, the animal inhaled either normal air or a helium/oxygen mixture (heliox) in which the velocity of sound is increased. Although heliox allows normal respiration, it alters the formant distribution of the sound spectrum. An acoustic analysis of the calls showed that the source signal components remained constant under both conditions, but an upward shift of high-energy frequency bands was observed in heliox. We conclude that these frequency bands represent formants. We suggest that crocodilian vocalizations could thus provide an acoustic indication of body size via formants. Because birds and crocodilians share a common ancestor with all dinosaurs, a better understanding of their vocal production systems may also provide insight into the communication of extinct Archosaurians.},

(1) Physical properties of surfaces regulate cell attachment and physiology and affect early stages of biofilm formation. (2) Chemical properties influence the adhesion of cells to surfaces and their development into biofilms and communities. (3) Chemical communication between cells attenuates growth and influences the organization of communities. Mechanisms of spatial and temporal confinement control the dimensions of communities and the diffusion path length for chemical communication between biofilms, which, in turn, influences biofilm phenotypes. Armed with a detailed understanding of biofilm formation, researchers are applying the tools and techniques of materials science and engineering to revolutionize the study and control of bacterial communities growing at interfaces.},

The children bit the tube with maximum force three times successively for 5s, with a 10s interval among each bite, and the sign was sent directly to the computer. The highest value of the three, for each patient, was considered. Analysis of variance evaluated difference among the three groups. The means of maximum bite force were 21317, 24963 and 24119N for the groups, respectively, and there were no significant statistical differences among them (P{$>$}0{$\cdot$}05). The analysis of correlation showed that the weight, height and bite force presented weak positive correlation (r=0{$\cdot$}24 and 0{$\cdot$}23).

Few studies have devoted efforts towards this goal, as the Somme displays a relatively smooth topography, giving the impression that its site location patterns were homogeneous. The results of this study indicate that the physical landscape did influence site location: rural settlements were more often located in flat areas or gentle valley slopes near rivers. Socio-economic factors, such as the accessibility of local markets, however, seem to hold even more influence over site location than the physical landscape, since the preference for well-connected areas appears for all types of farms. If all areas could be settled by Roman farmers, well-connected areas were therefore viewed as more suitable than others.},

Study selection: Studies were selected for their relevance and contemporary nature re:composition and formation of dental calculus and comparisons of ethnic groups with regard to dental calculus, especially subgingival calculus. Some similar studies were not included. Data extraction: Abstracts of studies were kept brief unless particularly important to the review. Population, methodology, statistics and accurate conclusions were used as important guides to the quality and validity of studies. Data synthesis: Similarities and differences between supragingival and subgingival calculus in composition and formation were shown. Different morphological types of subgingival calculus were demonstrated. There was evidence for an association between calculus formation and ethnicity with regard to supragingival and subgingival calculus, and an association between subgingival calculus composition and ethnicity was indicated. Conclusions: An association between ethnicity and subgingival calculus formation and composition was found. Further research into the reasons for these ethnic differences in dental calculus and the role of the mineral constituents especially of subgingival calculus would be valuable.},

Cysteine protease activities were elevated in saliva and gland lysates from 20-week-old NOD and NOD-scid mice as compared with age- and sex-matched BALB/c or 8-week-old NOD mice. This activity appeared in the submandibular glands, but not in the parotid glands. Western blot analyses using antibodies directed against specific apoptotic proteases (interleukin 1{$\beta$} converting enzyme, Nedd-2, and Apopain/CPP 32) confirmed these findings. Submandibular glands from NOD-scid mice exhibited the greatest increase in proteolytic activity, indicating that infiltrating leukocytes are not responsible for these changes. Western blot analyses also failed to reveal changes in the levels of cystatins (saliva proteins that inhibit protease activity). Thus, increased cysteine protease activity appears to be directly related to submandibular acinar cell loss in NOD-scid mice involving the apoptotic pathway. Additional protease activity in saliva and gland lysates of older NOD and NOD-scid mice, apparently mutually distinct from cysteine proteases, generated an enzymatically cleaved parotid secretory protein. We suggest, therefore, that proteolytic enzyme activity contributes to loss of exocrine gland tolerance by generating abnormally processed protein constituents.

They babble and touch their own body, attracted and actively involved in investigating the rich intermodal redundancies, temporal contingencies, and spatial congruence of self-perception. Recent research is presented, which investigats the spatial and temporal determinants of self-perception and action infancy. This research shows that, in the course of the first weeks of life, infants develop an ability to detect intermodal invariants and regularities in their sensorimotor experience, which specify themselves as separate entities agent in the environment. Recent observations on the detection of intermodal invariants regarding self-produced leg movements and auditory feedback of sucking by young infants are reported. These observations demonstrate that, early in development and long before mirror self-recognition, infants develop a perceptual ability to specify themselves. It is tentatively proposed that young infants' propensity to engage in self-perception and systematic exploration of the perceptual consequences of their own action plays an important role in the intermodal calibration of the body and is probably at the origin of an early sense of self: the ecological self.}

  abstract = {Concerns have been raised about the use of relative abundance data derived from next generation sequencing as a proxy for absolute abundances. For example, in the differential abundance setting, compositional effects in relative abundance data may give rise to spurious differences (false positives) when considered from the absolute perspective. In practice however, relative abundances are often transformed by renormalization strategies intended to compensate for these effects and the scope of the practical problem remains unclear. We used simulated data to explore the consistency of differential abundance calling on renormalized relative abundances versus absolute abundances and find that, while overall consistency is high, with a median sensitivity (true positive rates) of 0.91 and specificity (1 - false positive rates) of 0.89, consistency can be much lower where there is widespread change in the abundance of features across conditions. We confirm these findings on a large number of real data sets drawn from 16S metabarcoding, expression array, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq experiments, where data sets with the greatest change between experimental conditions are also those with the highest false positive rates. Finally, we evaluate the predictive utility of summary features of relative abundance data themselves. Estimates of sparsity and the prevalence of feature-level change in relative abundance data give reasonable predictions of discrepancy in differential abundance calling in simulated data and can provide useful bounds for worst-case outcomes in real data.},

Therefore, the demand for techniques that provide a sufficient amount of information at adequate resolution is increasing. One major challenge for multispecies studies is that diversity and spatial organization often lead to a high degree of spatial and chemical heterogeneity. Many current approaches do not account for such heterogeneity and therefore only provide average information (-omics techniques in particular), which could obscure important information about the community. Here, we bring attention to the issues of heterogeneity when analysing synthetic multi-species biofilms, in vitro, and the importance of multi-scale approaches. We provide an overview of current and newer approaches that can be applied to biofilm communities, in order to elucidate interactions at the appropriate scale.},

  abstract = {Interactions between bacteria and salivary components are thought to be important in the establishment and ecology of the oral microflora. {$\alpha$}-Amylase, the predominant salivary enzyme in humans, binds to Streptococcus gordonii, a primary colonizer of the tooth. Previous studies have implicated this interaction in adhesion of the bacteria to salivary pellicles, catabolism of dietary starches, and biofilm formation. Amylase binding is mediated at least in part by the amylase-binding protein A (AbpA). To study the function of this protein, an erythromycin resistance determinant [erm(AM)] was inserted within the abpA gene of S. gordonii strains Challis and FAS4 by allelic exchange, resulting in abpA mutant strains Challis-E1 and FAS4-E1. Comparison of the wild-type and mutant strains did not reveal any significant differences in colony morphology, biochemical metabolic profiles, growth in complex or defined media, surface hydrophobicity, or coaggregation properties. Scatchard analysis of adhesion isotherms demonstrated that the wild-type strains adhered better to human parotid-saliva- and amylase-coated hydroxyapatite than did the AbpA mutants. In contrast, the mutant strains bound to whole-saliva-coated hydroxyapatite to a greater extent than did the wild-type strains. While the wild-type strains preincubated with purified salivary amylase grew well in defined medium with potato starch as the sole carbohydrate source, the AbpA mutants did not grow under the same conditions even after preincubation with amylase. In addition, the wild-type strain produced large microcolonies in a flow cell biofilm model, while the abpA mutant strains grew much more poorly and produced relatively small microcolonies. Taken together, these results suggest that AbpA of S. gordonii functions as an adhesin to amylase-coated hydroxyapatite, in salivary-amylase-mediated catabolism of dietary starches and in human saliva-supported biofilm formation by S. gordonii.},

  abstract = {The attachment of dental calculus to the tooth (enamel or cementum) surface affects the ease or difficulty of its removal. Understanding the ultrastructural features of the calculus\textendash tooth interface will help in the development of efficient strategies for efficient removal of dental calculus. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the ultrastructural characteristics of the calculus\textendash tooth interface in relation to the occurrence of calculus fracture. Design: Investigation of the ultrastructural characteristics of the calculus\textendash tooth interface was made on eight human molars with mature supragingival and subgingival calculus using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Results: Fractures were shown by SEM to consistently occur within the calculus itself, but not at the calculus\textendash tooth interface. Higher magnification revealed that the enamel apatite crystals (in the case of supragingival calculus) or the cementum apatite crystals (in the case of subgingival calculus) appeared intimately connected with the calculus crystals at the calculus\textendash enamel or calculus\textendash cementum interface. TEM micrographs confirmed this intimate direct connection or fusion (epitaxial growth) of calculus crystals with enamel and cementum apatite crystals. FT-IR showed lower concentrations of organic phase attributed to microorganisms and higher concentrations of collagen at the calculus\textendash cementum interface compared to that in the calculus away from the interface. Conclusion: Difficulty in complete calculus removal from tooth surfaces (especially from cementum or dentin) may be due in part to the intimate contact between the calculus and the tooth, due to the chemical bonding between the calculus crystals and the tooth apatite crystals and occasional fusion (i.e., epitaxial growth) of the calculus calcium phosphate crystals with the enamel, dentin or apatite crystals. This cohesive bonding results in fracture planes occurring within the calculus instead of at the calculus\textendash tooth interface.},

  abstract = {Background Hair analysis is a suitable way to discriminate between coca chewers and consumers of manufactured cocaine using the coca alkaloids hygrine (HYG) and cuscohygrine (CUS) as markers. In the present preliminary study it was examined whether CUS and HYG can be detected in hair of occasional and moderate coca chewers or coca tea drinkers, whether CUS and HYG appear in hair of PACO consumers (smoking coca paste waste), and whether anhydroecgonine methyl ester (AEME) is a useful cocaine smoking marker in this context. Method Three groups were included: 10 volunteers from Buenos Aires with occasional or moderate chewing of coca leaves or drinking coca tea, 20 Argentinean PACO smokers and 8 German cocaine users. The hair samples (1\textendash 4 segments) were analyzed by a validated LC\textendash MS/MS method for cocaine (COC), norcocaine (NC), benzoylecgonine (BE), ecgonine methyl ester (EME), cocaethylene (CE), cinnamoylcocaine (CIN), tropacocaine (TRO), AEME, CUS and HYG. For comparison, eight samples of coca leaves or coca tea were analyzed. Results Only low concentrations of COC were found in hair of seven occasional users of coca leaves or coca tea (0.010\textendash 0.051\,ng/mg). For three moderate chewers of coca leaves all compounds were detected including AEME but except TRO. The hair samples of PACO smokers contained much higher concentrations of COC (0.027\textendash 341\,ng/mg, mean 37.4\,ng/mg) and its metabolites. CUS was not found in these samples but traces of HYG were seen in 8 of 37 hair segments. AEME as a marker for coca smoking was detected in hair of 15 smokers. In comparison to COC, the concentrations of EME and CIN were higher for PACO smokers than for German cocaine consumers. AEME (56\,{$\pm$}\,20\,{$\mu$}g/g) was detected in all coca leave and coca tea samples which explains the detection of this substance in hair of coca chewers. Therefore, its use for differentiation between coca chewers and PACO smokers is limited. Conclusion CUS remains to be the most suitable marker in hair for chewing coca leaves or drinking coca tea more frequently than two times per month since it does not appear in hair of Argentinean PACO smokers and German cocaine users. Contrary to a previous proposal, the ratios CIN/COC and EME/COC appeared not to be applicable as criteria for this purpose because of the higher concentration of these alkaloids in hair of PACO smokers. More research is needed to assess the value of AEME in hair of South American coca leave or cocaine users.},

However, an analysis of topographical variations in itch intensity, the effectiveness of scratching to provide itch relief and the associated pleasurability has not been performed at different body sites. Objectives To examine the role of scratching pleasurability in providing itch relief by investigating whether itch intensity is perceived differently at three different sites and to assess a potential correlation between the pleasurability and itch attenuation induced by scratching. Methods Itch was induced on the forearm, ankle and back using cowhage spicules in 18 healthy subjects. These sites were subsequently scratched by an investigator with a cytology brush immediately following itch induction. The intensity of itch with and without scratching at these sites and the pleasurability of scratching were recorded by taking visual analogue scale ratings at 30-s intervals. Results Mean itch intensity and scratching pleasurability ratings at the ankle and back were significantly higher than on the forearm. For the forearm and ankle, the greater the itch while scratching, the higher was the pleasurability. A higher baseline itch was linked to a higher itch reduction secondary to scratching in all tested areas. Pleasurability paralleled the curve of itch reduction for the back and forearm; however, scratching pleasurability at the ankle remained elevated and only slightly decreased while itch was diminishing. Conclusions There are topographical differences in itch intensity, the effectiveness of scratching in relieving itch and the associated pleasurability. Experimental itch induced by cowhage was more intensely perceived at the ankle, while scratching attenuated itch most effectively on the back.},

  abstract = {Palaeodietary reconstruction using the carbon and nitrogen isotope values of bone and dentine collagen is a well-established method and the biochemical processes involved are well known. Researchers have recently explored using bulk samples of dental calculus as a substitute for bone and dentine collagen in dietary analyses, because calculus can be sampled without causing damage to the teeth, and may be useful in situations where more destructive analyses are not possible, or where collagen is poorly preserved. Several questions remain about the use of bulk calculus as a source of carbon and nitrogen isotope data, however. It is not yet clear how much of an individual's life span dental calculus represents, what portions of the diet it records, and how diagenesis effects the carbon and nitrogen isotope values of this material. Most importantly, there have been no comparative studies of collagen and calculus isotope values, which are necessary to establish the value of bulk calculus as a source of accurate isotope values. Here we report the comparison of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses of bulk calculus to those from bone and dentine collagen. These analyses have been performed on individuals from the El Raval Mud\'ejar Medieval Cemetery (Eastern Iberia, 15th century A.D.). Although calculus isotope values may be broadly similar to expected values at the population level, we report here no correlation between collagen and bulk dental calculus values at the individual level. As a result, we recommend that carbon and nitrogen analysis on bulk dental calculus should only be used as a last resource archaeological dietary marker, if at all.},

In the present study, we augment the understanding of ancient oral microbiomes by characterizing human dental calculus samples recovered from the ancient Abbey of Badia Pozzeveri (central Italy), with differences in socioeconomic status, time period, burial type, and sex. Samples dating from the Middle Ages (11th century) to the Industrial Revolution era (19th century) were characterized using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene V4 region. Consistent with previous studies, individuals from Badia Pozzeveri possessed commensal oral bacteria that resembled modern oral microbiomes. These results suggest that members of the oral microbiome are ubiquitous despite differences in geographical regions, time period, sex, and socioeconomic status. The presence of fecal bacteria could be in agreement with poor hygiene practices, consistent with the time period. Respiratory tract, nosocomial, and other rare pathogens detected in the dental calculus samples are intriguing and could suggest subject-specific comorbidities that could be reflected in the oral microbiome.},

It is well suited to datasets with many missing values, and it is generally used to compute distance matrices and represent phenograms. Although often used in biological anthropology and archaeozoology, this method suffers from a lack of implementation in common statistical software. A package for the R statistical software, AnthropMMD, is presented here. Offering a dynamic graphical user interface, it is the first one dedicated to Smith's mean measure of divergence. The package also provides facilities for graphical representations and the crucial step of trait selection, so that the entire analysis can be performed through the graphical user interface. Its use is demonstrated using an artificial dataset, and the impact of trait selection is discussed. Finally, AnthropMMD is compared to three other free tools available for calculating the mean measure of divergence, and is proven to be consistent with them.}

This work aims to explore data from morbidity and mortality of individuals who contracted or died of TB after Koch bacillus discovery and before the development of antibiotics, using this information to interpret the scarcity of evidences detectable by paleopathological studies. To fulfill these goals, the Coimbra University Hospital and Coimbra Municipality Cemetery records from 1919 to 1928 were analyzed. As expected, pulmonary TB was the most common form of the diseases, both at hospital admission (43.7\%, n=904) and as cause of death of the individuals inhumed, especially after the age of 10 years. In children under 10 years, meningeal TB was the more common form. Pott's diseases represented only 4.7\% (n=98) of the hospital admission due to TB and 0.7\% (n=8) of the TB deaths at the cemetery. However, in paleopathology the macroscopic evidence of TB comes mainly from Pott's disease. Documented skeletons shows that new bone on visceral surfaces of ribs can occurs in other diseases besides pulmonary TB but its presence can be also use as an indicative of possible TB infection.},

In this study, we used indirect Enzyme Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) to measure O. viverrini-specific immunoglobulins in serum, urine and saliva and assessed efficacies in diagnosis of opisthorchiasis and evaluated the relationship of antibodies among clinical specimens in a sample population in endemic areas in Khon Kaen, Thailand. By employing the Receiver Operation Characteristics (ROC) analysis, diagnostic efficacy based upon the area under the curve (AUC) revealed that serum, salivary IgG and IgA performed better than urine for diagnosis of opisthorchiasis. Seropositive cases were found in both parasite egg-negative as well as O. viverrini egg-positive groups. The levels of serum IgG correlated with intensity of O. viverrini infection (P{$<$}0.05). Diagnostic sensitivities based on serum and salivary IgG, IgA also positively associated with the intensity of infection. Correlations between serum antibodies and those in saliva were found to be greater in egg-negative than egg-positive individuals for O. viverrini. Our findings indicated a complex interrelation between antibody responses in different clinical specimens triggered by liver fluke infection. More comprehensive examinations are needed to determine the potential utility of salivary antibody detection which, in combination with the conventional fecal examination method, may better assist in the identification of individuals with opisthorchiasis. Furthermore, it may provide a better indicator of the risk of disease, particularly CCA.},

This interaction is inhibited by substrates such as starch and maltotriose suggesting that bacterial binding may involve the enzymatic site of amylase. Experiments were performed to determine if amylase bound to the bacterial surface possessed enzymatic activity. It was found that over one-half of the bound amylase was enzymatically active. In addition, bacterial-bound amylase hydrolyzed starch to glucose which was then metabolized to lactic acid by the bacteria. In further studies, the role of amylase's histidine residues in streptococcal binding and enzymatic function was assessed after their selective modification with diethyl pyrocarbonate. DEP-modified amylase showed a marked reduction in both enzymatic and streptococcal binding activities. These effects were diminished when DEP modification occurred in the presence of maltotriose. DEP-modified amylase had a significantly altered secondary structure when compared with native enzyme or amylase modified in the presence of maltotriose. Collectively, these results suggest that human salivary {$\alpha$}-amylase may possess multiple sites for bacterial binding and enzymatic activity which share structural similarities.},

To assess the importance of this interaction in bacterial colonization of the oral cavity, we determined the proportion and identity of amylase-binding bacteria (ABB) in dental plaque of humans and various salivary amylase-secreting and non-secreting mammalian species. The numbers of ABB in undisturbed plaque collected over time from tooth surfaces of six human volunteers or from 14 other mammalian species were determined by means of a replica-plating assay. The mean proportion of ABB cultured aerobically from human teeth at 2 h was 10.5\% (SD 10), at 8 h 7.9\% (8), at 24 h 13\% (11), and at 48 h 12\% (9). The mean proportion of anaerobically cultured ABB found at 2 h was 3\% (SD 4), at 8 h 5\% (5), at 24 h 12\% (9), and at 48 h 16\% (12). Amylase-binding bacteria cultured from these samples resembled Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus crista, or unidentified streptococci. In addition, only animals exhibiting salivary amylase activity in their saliva harbored ABB (ranging from 2 to 31\% of the total flora), with the exception of the pig, where no ABB were found to colonize, despite considerable amylase activity in saliva. Only strains resembling S. mitis and S. salivarius and unspeciated strains were isolated from these mammals. These results suggest that amylase-binding streptococci are the predominant ABB in human plaque, and their numbers generally increase as plaque develops. Since ABB colonized only the oral cavities of hosts demonstrating salivary amylase activity, the ability to bind amylase may play an important role in oral colonization by these bacteria.},

The present study evaluated these potential associations by analyzing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES III), which documents the general health and nutritional status of randomly selected United States subjects from 1988 to 1994. Methods: This cross-sectional, retrospective study of the NHANES III database included a study population of 13,792 subjects {$\geq$}20 years of age with at least 6 natural teeth. A history of bronchitis and/or emphysema was recorded from the medical questionnaire, and a dichotomized variable combined those with either chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema, together considered as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Subject lung function was estimated by calculating the ratio of forced expiratory volume (FEV) after 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC). Oral health status was assessed from the DMFS/T index (summary of cumulative caries experience), gingival bleeding, gingival recession, gingival probing depth, and periodontal attachment level. Unweighted analyses were used for initial examination of the data, and a weighted analysis was performed in a final logistic regression model adjusting for age, gender, race and ethnicity, education, income, frequency of dental visits, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and alcohol use. Results: The mean age of all subjects was 44.4 {$\pm$} 17.8 years (mean {$\pm$} SD): COPD = 51.2 {$\pm$} 17.9 years and subjects without COPD = 43.9 {$\pm$} 17.7 years. Subjects with a history of COPD had more periodontal attachment loss than subjects without COPD (1.48 {$\pm$} 1.35 mm versus 1.17 {$\pm$} 1.09 mm, P = 0.0001). Subjects with mean attachment loss (MAL) {$\geq$}3.0 mm had a higher risk of COPD than those having MAL {$<$}3.0 mm (odds ratio, 1.45; 95\% CI, 1.02 to 2.05). A trend was noted in that lung function appeared to diminish with increasing periodontal attachment loss. Conclusions: The findings of the present analysis support recently published reports that suggest an association between periodontal disease and COPD. J Periodontol 2001;72:50-56.},

For example, recent evidence has suggested a central role for the oral cavity in the process of respiratory infection. Oral periodontopathic bacteria can be aspirated into the lung to cause aspiration pneumonia. The teeth may also serve as a reservoir for respiratory pathogen colonization and subsequent nosocomial pneumonia. Typical respiratory pathogens have been shown to colonize the dental plaque of hospitalized intensive care and nursing home patients. Once established in the mouth, these pathogens may be aspirated into the lung to cause infection. Other epidemiologic studies have noted a relationship between poor oral hygiene or periodontal bone loss and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Several mechanisms are proposed to explain the potential role of oral bacteria in the pathogenesis of respiratory infection: 1. aspiration of oral pathogens (such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, etc.) into the lung to cause infection; 2. periodontal disease-associated enzymes in saliva may modify mucosal surfaces to promote adhesion and colonization by respiratory pathogens, which are then aspirated into the lung; 3. periodontal disease-associated enzymes may destroy salivary pellicles on pathogenic bacteria to hinder their clearance from the mucosal surface; and 4. cytokines originating from periodontal tissues may alter respiratory epithelium to promote infection by respiratory pathogens.

  abstract = {In the late medieval period, Holland experienced substantial socio-economic change. While the region was largely undeveloped prior to 1200 CE, the period after was characterised by extensive urbanisation and flourishing international trade, changes that would have impacted many aspects of life. This paper investigates the effect of these changes on diet by comparing skeletal collections from the early/central medieval rural village of Blokhuizen (800\textendash 1200 CE) to the late medieval urban town of Alkmaar (1448\textendash 1572 CE) using a combination of the prevalence and location of carious lesions (nteeth = 3475) and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data (n = 50). Results show that the urban Alkmaar population had a significantly higher caries frequency (7.4\% vs. 16.1\%), starting at a younger age. Moreover, Alkmaar had significantly more approximal caries. These results point to increased consumption of cariogenic products, such as sugars and starches, by the urban citizens. Dietary differences are also demonstrated by the stable isotope data. Alkmaar individuals have significantly enriched {$\delta$}15N ratios and more variable {$\delta$}13C ratios compared with rural Blokhuizen. The elevated {$\delta$}15N values may be due to increased consumption of fish or animals such as omnivorous pigs and chickens. The combination of caries and isotopic data points to clear changes in diet suggesting that urban individuals in the late medieval period had a substantially different diet compared with early rural inhabitants from the same area. Specifically, an increase in market dependence, availability of international trade products, and the growth of commercial fishing in the late medieval period may have contributed to this dietary shift. Future research should include a late medieval rural population to better understand the effects of late medieval socio-economic developments outside of the urban environment. This study demonstrates that the integration of palaeopathology and stable isotopic research provides a more complete understanding of dietary changes in medieval Holland.},

Pioneer colonizers represent a selected part of the oral microflora, and it has been assumed that specific adhesin-receptor interactions between the microbial surface and the pellicle account for this specificity. Whereas microbial adhesion to tooth surfaces is a general prerequisite for initiation of plaque formation, microbial multiplication is probably the dominant feature in the build-up of dental plaque. Local environmental factors which influence the establishment and composition of the ultimate plaque community are therefore of greater importance than initial adhesion per se. The highly individual and site-related characteristics of the plaque flora illustrate the selective power of the environment. Environmental conditions are not uniform. Thus, each site represents its own conditions are not uniform. Thus, each site represents its own distinct ecosystem, and the microbial composition at the site depends on the outcome of a variety of host-microbial and microbial-microbial interactions. The relative in vivo significance of these interactions is difficult to assess.},

Despite the high burden of this condition, to date there is no evidence-based treatment available. In this study we evaluated the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and investigated whether clinical or demographic characteristics predicted treatment response. Methods Ninety patients with misophonia received eight bi-weekly group CBT sessions. Treatment response was defined as a Clinical Global Impression \textendash{} Improvement Scale (CGI-I) score at endpoint of 1 or 2 (very much or much improved) and a 30\% or greater reduction on the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S), a measure of the severity of misophonia symptoms. Results Following treatment 48\% (N=42) of the patients showed a significant reduction of misophonia symptoms. Severity of misophonia and the presence of disgust were positive predictors of treatment response. Limitations The A-MISO-S is not a validated scale. Furthermore, this was an open-label study with a waiting list control condition. Conclusions This is the first treatment study for misophonia. Our results suggest that CBT is effective in half of the patients.},

In order to shed light on the transformation of Eastern Mediterranean cuisines during the Bronze Age and Early Iron Age, we analyzed microremains and proteins preserved in the dental calculus of individuals who lived during the second millennium BCE in the Southern Levant. Our results provide clear evidence for the consumption of expected staple foods, such as cereals (Triticeae), sesame (Sesamum), and dates (Phoenix). We additionally report evidence for the consumption of soybean (Glycine), probable banana (Musa), and turmeric (Curcuma), which pushes back the earliest evidence of these foods in the Mediterranean by centuries (turmeric) or even millennia (soybean). We find that, from the early second millennium onwards, at least some people in the Eastern Mediterranean had access to food from distant locations, including South Asia, and such goods were likely consumed as oils, dried fruits, and spices. These insights force us to rethink the complexity and intensity of Indo-Mediterranean trade during the Bronze Age as well as the degree of globalization in early Eastern Mediterranean cuisine.}

We review the process of weaning, which can be informative of subsistence transitions, maternal labour, demographic factors including birth spacing and infant health, and highlight the relationships between weaning, immune status, and exposure to pathogens. Prior microwear research has largely focused on adults necessitating consideration of the methods concerning deciduous teeth. Microwear can be used to discern between the consistency and fracture properties of food as enamel is removed during mastication, and is influenced by how food is prepared (for example premasticated, raw, cooked). As such, microwear provides a direct way to explore the introduction of complementary foods during weaning. A conceptual model of the potential confounders of assessing microwear in deciduous teeth including tooth biology, bite force, and the development of oral mechanics is presented. These are pertinent to understanding infant feeding, which changes in tandem with physical development and the sequence of dental eruption. This is relevant to future research for the interpretation of the microwear signatures of infants compared with adults. Understanding weaning practices and early life diet is crucial to expand and develop what we know about cultural systems, population health, nutrition, and subsistence practices in the past.},

We present a study of 11 purported archaeological cooking installations from three different Bronze and Iron Age sites in Israel in which we deployed a variety of microarchaeological techniques. We provide direct physical evidence, based on Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy demonstrating that the archaeological installations were operated with temperatures as high as 900~\textdegree C. Using this technique we also demonstrate that all the mud-constructed installations studied by us were internally-fueled and therefore should be identified as Tannurs rather than the externally- fueled Tabuns. We studied in detail the quantities of ash-related microscopic remains, including opaline phytoliths, calcitic wood ash pseudomorphs and dung spherulites. We show that phytolith morphotype analysis cannot distinguish between wood-dominated and dung-dominated fuel materials, while a newly developed method that calculates the ratio of ash pseudomorphs to dung spherulites (PSR method) makes such a distinction possible.~Moreover, we experimented with the effect of partial dissolution on fuel ash PSR values and utilize the results to explain taphonomy and diagenesis associated with two types of archaeological cooking installations \textendash{} pebble hearths and baking ovens. In addition, we identified micromorphological criteria that can be used to assess whether ash deposits in or above a cooking installations are in situ and/or disturbed. Taken together, all lines of evidence used in this study indicate that wood was the major fuel material across time and space in the studied archaeological contexts, while dung was a secondary source of fuel. This observation also cross-cuts different culture-historical entities (Philistines, Canaanites, Israelites and Egyptians). In addition, wood was preferred as fuel irrespective of environmental differences among the studied sites. This study is yet another demonstration of the value of integrating microarchaeological techniques and approaches to traditional macroscopic archaeology.},

  abstract = {In the Middle Ages, palliative dietary regimens were fundamental to the treatment of disease. It was believed that the foods eaten were central to bringing balance to the human body. Alleviating the symptoms of leprosy required the consumption of foods considered moist and mild, which included certain kinds of meat. Medieval lepers were housed and treated in leprosaria (leper hospitals), often located on the outskirts of towns and cities. The quality of the food consumed at each institution, however, varied considerably according to its financial situation. The extent to which the diet of lepers corresponded to that advised by Medieval physicians, therefore, remains largely uncertain. Here, a method of 3D dental wear pattern analysis, called Occlusal Fingerprint Analysis, is used to infer the dietary composition of individuals interred at the cemetery associated with the medieval leprosarium and later almshouse of St James and St Mary Magdalene, Chichester (n~=~24). It was found that the dental wear pattern of individuals with osseous changes consistent with lepromatous leprosy showed an enlargement of buccal phase I wear when compared to the rest of the cemetery and a comparative group interred at St Michael's Litten lay cemetery, Chichester (n~=~17). Differences in dental wear patterns suggest that the lepers at this cemetery had regular access to meat beyond the quantities consumed by the majority of the lower social strata of Medieval society and more consistent with the palliative care recommended by Medieval medical theory.},

DNA was extracted from 67 selected samples of each donor, and the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR and pyrosequenced to obtain, on average, over 2,700 reads per sample, which were taxonomically assigned to obtain a geographic map of bacterial diversity at each tooth and sulcus location. Analysis of the data shows considerable differences in bacterial composition between teeth at different intra-oral locations and between surfaces of the same tooth. The most pronounced differences were observed in incisors and canines, where genera like Streptococcus were found at 40\% to 70\% on the vestibular surfaces but were almost absent on the lingual sides. Saliva samples, especially non-stimulated saliva, were not representative of supra-and subgingival plaque in the two individuals tested.

Data Caries is a biofilm-mediated oral disease and in vitro biofilm models have been widely utilised to assess how anticariogenic or antimicrobial agents affect the de/remineralisation process of caries. The use of enamel or dentine substrata has enabled the assessment of the relationship between bacterial activity and caries lesion initiation and progression and how this relationship could be affected by the agent under study. Sources Only papers published in the English literature were reviewed. Study selection Both `open' and `closed' biofilm systems utilising either single or multiple-species as defined or undefined inocula are analysed. Conclusions There is a wide variety of in vitro biofilm models used in the assessment of anticariogenic agents. A reproducible model that mimics the shear forces present in the oral environment, and uses a defined multiple-species inocula on tooth substrates can provide valuable insight into the effectiveness of these agents.

  abstract = {Difficulties with in vivo studies of natural plaque and its complex, heterogeneous structure have led to development of laboratory biofilm plaque model systems. Technologies for their culture are outlined, and the rationale, strengths, and relative uses of two complementary approaches to microbial models with a focus on plaque biodiversity are analyzed. Construction of synthetic consortia biofilms of major plaque species has established a variety of bacterial interactions important in plaque development. In particular, the 'Marsh' nine-species biofilm consortia systems are powerful quasi steady-state models which can be closely specified, modified, and analyzed. In the second approach, microcosm plaque biofilms are evolved in vitro from the natural oral microflora to the laboratory model most closely related to plaque in vivo. Functionally reproducible microcosm plaques are attainable with a biodiverse microbiota, heterogeneous structure, and pH behavior consistent with those of natural plaque. The resting pH can be controlled by urea supply. Their growth patterns, pH gradient formation, control of urease levels by environmental effectors, and plaque mineralization have been investigated. Microcosm biofilms may be the only useful in vitro systems where the identity of the microbes and processes involved is uncertain. Together, these two approaches begin to capture the complexity of plaque biofilm development, ecology, behavior, and pathology. They facilitate hypothesis testing across almost the whole range of plaque biology and the investigation of antiplaque procedures yielding accurate predictions of plaque behavior in vivo.},

  abstract = {The origin of ureolytic activity in artificial-mouth plaques was established by assessing the contribution to plaque ureolytic activity of the isolated bacteria. To overcome losses of ureolytic activity caused by the unstable presence of urease in oral bacteria, ureolytic bacteria were isolated from an exceptionally active plaque (1 {$\mu$}mol NH3/min per mg protein) in which 63 per cent of the flora was ureolytic. After their ability to metabolize urea was stabilized, 13 ureolytic bacteria remained: seven strains of Streptococcus salivarius, one Streptococcus bovis, two Straphylococcus epidermidis and three Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Their urease activity, measured after growth into stationary phase, was reproducible and strain specific with a 20-fold range within each genus. The mean ureolytic activity of each species, when weighted by its calculated incidence in the original plaque, accounted for 40 per cent of the total plaque ureolytic activity. However, these values for urease levels were only a small fraction of the bacterial ureolytic potential. Urease per mg cell protein measured during the growth cycle of a selected Strep. salivarius, and Staph. epidermidis, varied 10-fold, and reached much higher activities (i.e. 6\textendash 8 {$\mu$}mol NH3/ min per mg of cell protein) than under the growth conditions that were used to assess the contribution of these species to total plaque ureolysis. Thus urea metabolism in artificial plaque was due mainly to Strep. salivarius, with a small contribution from Staph. epidermidis. The presence of further unidentified species of ureolytic oral bacteria need not be invoked.},

  abstract = {This study examined in detailed the pH response of mircrocosm plaque biofilms to the application of 500 mmol/l urea, and the effect of modifying the flow rate of BMM (a basal medium containing 0.25\% mucin). Microcosm plaques were cultured from the mixed salivary bacteria in a multi-plaque `artificial mouth' supplied continuously with BMM at 3.6 ml/h per plaque, and periodically with sucrose (5 or 10\%). Urea (500 mmol/l) induced a pH response that was the inverse of the Stephan pH curve induced by sucrose. In thicker plaques the ureolytic pH response was delayed and slower. With no BMM flow, the urea-induced pH curve reached a maximum and then slowly decreased indicating loss of ammonia. A flow of BMM reduced the magnitude of the pH response. Urea dilution explained (r2 = 0.97) the reduction in the maximum rate of pH rise caused by an increasing BMM flow. There were, however, additional flow-rate effects on the magnitude of the pH rise, the curve areas and the maximum rate of pH decrease back to the resting pH. These effects were greatest at low BMM flow rates, indicating that ammonia clearance may be limited at higher flow rates by the rate of intraplaque diffusion and metabolism. Application of 50 instead of 500 mmol/l urea reduced the rate of pH rise about 10-fold, and the area of the curve about seven fold. Metabolism of arginine (50 mmol/l) generated only about half the pH response of the same amount of urea. Simple metabolism of urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide therefore generates a complex pH response that cannot be adequately described by any single pH change variable. The magnitude of the pH change depends more on urea concentration than the total amount applied. The pH response to urea is delayed and slower in thicker plaques, and the ammonia formed is cleared only slowly over many hours at a rate that is greatly affected by liquid flow over the plaque.},

All specimens are from Western Europe. Maturation rate is treated as the same for both samples for analytical purposes and evaluated in terms of the results. Analysis of reduction in crown volume with age indicates that the wear rate for the posterior permanent (P4\textendash M3) and primary teeth (dm2) does not differ between the samples; however the anterior primary teeth (di1\textendash dm1) are more worn in the UP sample with age held constant. By contrast, anterior permanent teeth (I1\textendash P3) wear more rapidly in the Neanderthal sample. Similar results are obtained in a comparison of relative attrition. The MP sample of anterior primary teeth lags about a year behind the UP sample in the degree of accumulated wear up to about age 5 years. Thereafter differences disappear. Analysis on the basis of individual specimens (ANOVA) confirms these results with the MP sample of anterior primary teeth significantly older (P=0{$\cdot$}0498) at successive wear stages. While the rate of wear of the anterior primary teeth does not differ between the samples, the age of attrition onset differs by about 1 year; age 2 years in the UP sample and 3 in the MP sample. It is concluded that dietary supplementation of infants commences 1 year earlier on average in the UP. Data are insufficient to determine whether the Late and Early Upper Paleolithic samples differ significantly in the study variables. Apart from the finding of earlier onset of dental wear in the UP, the lack of difference in the relationship between age and tooth wear supports a model of similar maturation rates and dietary abrasiveness in the Middle and Upper Paleolithic. Significantly earlier dietary supplementation of UP infants may have reduced birth spacing through diminished hormonal inhibition of ovulation. These results are compatible with demographic increase in the UP.},

Whether an assay is of quantitative value roughly corresponding to the amount of drug consumed, is still a matter of debate. The present investigation was aimed at a possible relationship between the cannabinoid concentration in hair and the cumulative dose in regular users of cannabis. Hair samples from the vertex region of the scalp were obtained from 12 male regular users of cannabis, and 10 male subjects with no experience of cannabis served as controls. None of the subjects had his hair permed, bleached or colored. Cannabis users provided information on drug use such as the current cannabis dose per day, the cumulative cannabis dose of the last 3 months, as well as the frequency of cannabis use during the last year. The concentration of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabinol (CBN) and cannabidiol (CBD) in hair was determined using gas chromatography\textendash mass spectrometry. Cannabinoids were present in any hair sample of cannabis users, but were not detectable in control specimens. An increase in the amount of cannabinoids in hair with increasing dose was evident. The concentration of major cannabinoids (sum of THC, CBD and CBN) was significantly correlated to either the reported cumulative cannabis dose during the last 3 months or to the cannabis use during the last 3 months estimated from the daily dose and the frequency per year (r=0.68 or 0.71, p=0.023 or 0.014). A significant relationship between THC and the amount of cannabis used could not be established. As a conclusion, the sum of major cannabinoids in hair of regular users may provide a better measure of drug use than THC.},

The first consists of 103 skeletons from seven Late Antique (3rd\textendash 6th century AD) sites, the second of 151 skeletons from three Early Medieval (7th\textendash 11th centuries AD) sites. As recent bioarhaeological studies (\v{S}laus, 2008) showed a significant increase of disease loads and trauma frequencies in Dalmatia during the Early Medieval period, the aim of this study was to investigate whether dental health was equally adversely affected by the Late Antique/Early Medieval transition. The results of our analyses show that the frequencies of carious lesions, ante mortem tooth loss, abscesses and alveolar resorption increased significantly during the Early Medieval period, as did the degree of heavy occlusal wear on posterior teeth. These data suggest a change in alimentary habits, with a significantly higher dependence on carbohydrates and a greater reliance on hard, fibrous foods requiring vigorous mastication in the Early Medieval diet. The combination of higher calculus and lower caries rates in the Late Antique series similarly suggests more protein in the Late Antique diet and is, therefore, also consistent with the hypothesised change in alimentary habits. In general (the two exceptions are male caries and female alveolar resorption frequencies) lesion frequencies increased uniformly in both sexes suggesting that the deterioration of dental health during the Early Medieval period equally affected males and females. Cumulatively, the collected data suggest that the political, social, economic and religious changes that characterised the Late Antique/Early Medieval transition in Dalmatia resulted in a clear discontinuity, not only from the cultural, but also from the biological point of view with an evident deterioration of oral health during the Early Medieval period.

  abstract = {Age-at-death estimation is an essential step in both bioarchaeological and forensic studies when human remains are found, as this can also contribute to the identification of the individual. It is critical that age-at-death methods be tested verified in various populations, to obtain the most accurate estimation, making research into new age-at-death methods also imperative. Since osteophyte formation on the vertebral column increases with age, this can be used as a possible method of age-at-death estimation. Snodgrass (2004), Watanabe and Terazawa (2006) and Praneatpolgrang et al. (2019) have tested this method before and have provided promising results. We test the efficacy of Snodgrass (2004), Watanabe and Terazawa (2006), and Praneatpolgrang et al. (2019) on a 19th-century archivally recorded Dutch population. A total of 88 individuals, 40 males, and 48 females were scored for the degree of osteophyte formation on the vertebral column. In addition to testing the three methods above, population-specific regression equations were developed and tested. Accuracy percentages for estimating the age-at-death based on the mean osteophyte score of the entire vertebral column were obtained for all three methods (73.86\%, 76.14\%, and 72.73\%, respectively). In this study, a general pattern of osteophyte formation could be established, which is useful for estimating the age at death. We therefore recommend that this method can be used, cautiously as a means of age-at-death estimation.},

In this study, samples of modern and prehistoric hunter\textendash gatherers and agriculturalists are used to test the hypothesis that there are systematic differences in patterns of tooth wear related to major differences in subsistence and food preparation. Flatness of molar wear is compared for five groups of hunter\textendash gatherers (N = 298) and five groups of early agriculturalists (N = 365). Hunter\textendash gatherers are predicted to develop flatter molar wear due to the mastication of tough and fibrous foods, whereas agriculturalists should develop oblique molar wear due to an increase in the proportion of ground and prepared food in the diet. A method is presented for the quantitative measurement and analysis of flatness of molar wear. Comparisons of wear plane angle are made between teeth matched for the same stage of occlusal surface wear, thus standardizing all groups to the same rate of wear. Agriculturalists develop highly angled occlusal wear planes on the entire molar dentition. Their wear plane angles tend to exceed hunter\textendash gatherers by about 10\textdegree{} in advanced wear. Wear plane angles are similar within subsistence divisions despite regional differences in particular foods. This approach can be used to provide supporting evidence of change in human subsistence and to test dietary hypotheses in hominoid evolution.}

The technique used for estimating age from osteophyte development is based exclusively on males and it is unknown whether patterns of osteophyte development are comparable between the sexes. This study examines sex differences in osteophyte development in the thoracic and lumbar regions of 384 individuals from the Terry Collection. Males and females in this sample show remarkably similar patterns of age-related changes in osteophyte development; however, females show greater variability in osteophyte stage for a given age. This was confirmed with age-matching a subsample of 128 individuals. Therefore, slightly larger confidence intervals should be used when assessing age from the vertebral column in females.},

Due to the smallness of the material or statistical shortcomings in previous reports, improvements of the methods were desirable and seemed possible. As a contribution to such improvement various age-related changes have been studied in a material of 1000 teeth. For each type of change the kind of measurement most strongly related to age was chosen, and a multiple regression analysis was run with age as the dependent variable, using SPSS/PC+ statistical program. Statistically significant formulae were calculated for each type of tooth excluding molars. Because the sex of a deceased body may be unknown and the tooth colour influenced by changes after death, separate formulae excluding these factors were calculated. For the calculated formulae the Pearson correlation (r) varied from 0.76 in mandibular second premolars (SEX and COLOUR excluded), to 0.91 for maxillary central incisors; a rather promising result compared with other methods. In addition, the intercorrelations between the age-related factors were calculated after control for the effect of age. In some types of teeth, but not in all, some of the factors displayed significant intercorrelation. To compare these formulae with previous methods an unbiased test in another independent material is needed.},

  abstract = {Oral biofilm can never be fully removed by oral hygiene measures. Biofilm left behind after brushing is often left behind on the same sites and exposed multiple times to antimicrobials from toothpastes and mouthrinses, after which removal becomes increasingly difficult. On the basis of this observation, we hypothesize that oral bacteria adhering to salivary conditioning films become more difficult to remove after adsorption of antimicrobials due to stiffening of their adhesive bond. To verify this hypothesis, bacteria adhering to bare and saliva-coated glass were exposed to 3 different mouthrinses, containing chlorhexidine-digluconate, cetylpyridinium-chloride, or amine-fluoride, after which bacterial vibration spectroscopy was carried out or a liquid-air interface was passed over the adhering bacteria to stimulate their detachment. Brownian motion\textendash induced nanoscopic vibration amplitudes of 4 oral streptococcal strains, reflecting their bond stiffness, decreased after exposure to mouthrinses. Concurrently, the percentage detachment of adhering bacteria upon the passage of a liquid-air interface decreased after exposure to mouthrinses. A buffer control left both vibration amplitudes and detachment percentages unaffected. Exposure to either of the selected mouthrinses yielded more positively charged bacteria by particulate microelectrophoresis, suggesting antimicrobial adsorption to bacterial cell surface components. To rule out that exposure of adhering bacteria to the mouthrinses stimulated polysaccharide production with an impact on their detachment, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was carried out on bacteria adhering to an internal reflection element, prior to and after exposure to the mouthrinses. Infrared absorption band areas indicated no significant change in amount of polysaccharides after exposure of adhering bacteria to mouthrinses, but wave number shifts demonstrated stiffening of polysaccharides in the bond, as a result of antimicrobial adsorption to the bacterial cell surface and in line with changes in surface charge. Clinically, these findings suggest that accumulation of oral biofilm exposed to antimicrobials should be prevented (interdental cleaning aids, floss use), as removal becomes progressively more difficult upon multiple exposures.},

It is not uncommon in the practice of forensic medicine to find instances in which some teeth are missing, thereby adding to the difficulties in age estimation.

Song and Jia (1987). extended the use of this technique, adding multiple stepwise regression analysis, to the statistical examination of data derived from the study of attrition of the occlusal surfaces of teeth. The computer model thus derived provides a basis for an accurate assessment of age from qualitative material. This paper discusses the technique and is based upon the findings made during a study of the degree of occlusal attrition in 880 people, living in rural and urban areas of the Liaoning province of the People's Republic of China.}

Spring constants of the bond are derived from vibrational amplitudes and related to the electrophoretic softness of the cell surfaces and dissipation shifts measured upon bacterial adhesion in a quartzcrystal-microbalance (QCM-D). Experiments were conducted with six bacterial strains with pairwise differences in cell surface characteristics. Vibrational amplitudes were highest in low ionic strength suspensions. Under fluid flow, vibrational amplitudes were lower in the direction of flow than perpendicular to it because stretching of cell surface polymers in the direction of flow causes stiffening of the polyelectrolyte network surrounding a bacterium. Under static conditions (0.57 mM), vibrational amplitudes of fibrillated Streptococcus salivarius HB7 (145 nm) were higher than that of a bald mutant HB-C12 (76 nm). Amplitudes of moderately extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) producing Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC35983 (47 nm) were more than twice the amplitudes of strongly EPS producing S. epidermidis ATCC35984 (21 nm). No differences were found between Staphylococcus aureus strains differing in membrane cross-linking. High vibrational amplitudes corresponded with low dissipation shifts in QCM-D. In streptococci, the polyelectrolyte network surrounding a bacterium is formed by fibrillar surface appendages and spring constants derived from vibrational amplitudes decreased with increasing fibrillar density. In staphylococci, EPS constitutes the main network component, and larger amounts of EPS yielded higher spring constants. Spring constants increased with increasing ionic strength and strains with smaller electrophoretically derived bacterial cell surface softnesses possessed the highest spring constants.},

No significant decrease was observed in samples stored at -80\textdegree C during the test period of 5 months.

Samples preserved with a combination of the FC mixture and ASC showed almost similar improvements in cannabinoid stability.

  abstract = {Ancient dental calculus research currently relies on destructive techniques whereby archeological specimens are broken down to determine their contents. Two strategies that could partly remediate a permanent loss of the original sample and enhance future analysis and reproducibility include (1) structural surface characterization through spectroscopy along with crystallographic and spectroscopic analysis of its molecular structure, and (2) surface decontamination protocols in which the efficacy of cleaning dental calculus prior to extraction is demonstrated. Dental calculus provides ancient starch research a niche where granules may be adsorbed to minerals, coated, overgrown, entrapped, and/or protected from chemical degradation. While encapsulation offers protection from degradation, it does not shield the sample's surface from contamination. The most common approach to retrieving microbotanical particles from archeological calculus has been the direct decalcification of the sample, after a cleaning stage variously consisting of immersion in water, acids, and mechanical dislodgment via gas, sonication, and/or toothbrushes. Little is known about the efficiency of these methods for a complete removal of sediment/soil and unrelated microbotanical matter. In this paper, controlled laboratory experimentation leads to chemical structural characterization and a decontamination protocol to eradicate starch granules. Several concentrations of acids, bases, and enzymes were tested at intervals to understand their potential to gelatinize and fully destroy starch granules; arriving at a procedure that effectively eradicates modern starch prior to dissolution without damaging the matrix or entrapped starch microremains. This is the first attempt at creating synthetic calculus to understand and systematically test effective decontamination protocols for ancient starch research.},

This effect is particularly problematic for the study of juvenile individuals, as growth is particularly sensitive to environmental insults. In this study, we test whether biological mortality bias exists in one dimension of growth, namely dental development. Materials and methods Postmortem computed tomography scans of 206 children aged 12 years and younger at death were collected from two institutions in the United States and Australia. The sample was separated into children dying from natural causes as proxies for non-survivors and from accidental causes as proxies for survivors. Differences in the timing of dental development were assessed using sequential logistic regressions between dental formation stages and residual analysis of dental minus chronological age. Results No consistent delay in age of attainment of dental stages was documented between survivors and non-survivors. Delays between survivors and non-survivors in dental relative to chronological age were greatest for infants, and were greater for females than for males. Discussion Lack of biological mortality bias in dental development reinforces confidence in juvenile age estimates and therefore in skeletal growth profiles and growth studies. As dental development is known to be less environmentally sensitive than skeletal growth and development, further studies should examine biological mortality bias in long bone length.},

  abstract = {Today, osteoarticular tuberculosis (TB) is a rare extrapulmonary manifestation of TB, developing in about 1\textendash 3\% of patients. Although any part of the skeleton can be affected by tuberculosis, the spine represents the most common site of involvement (\textasciitilde 50\%). Spinal TB or tuberculous spondylitis typically affects 2 or more contiguous vertebrae, predominantly in the lower thoracic (40\textendash 50\%) and upper lumbar (35\textendash 40\%) regions. In the minority of patients (less than 10\%), multilevel noncontiguous involvement occurs. By the location of lesions in the vertebra, 5 main types of spinal TB can be distinguished: paradiscal, central, anterior subligamentous, posterior, and articular forms, with the first being the most common type (90\textendash 95\%). In the palaeopathological literature, the majority of the described spinal TB cases represent the paradiscal form affecting 2 or more contiguous vertebrae in the thoracolumbar region. The aim of our paper is to provide 3 example cases of known age at death, sex, and cause of death from the Terry Collection that show vertebral alterations indicative of rare manifestations of tuberculous spondylitis, and to interpret the observed lesions with regard to their diagnostic value in the palaeopathological practice. Terry No. 468 (23-year-old, male, died of pulmonary and spinal TB) exhibited bony changes presumably attributed to the anterior subligamentous form, whereas Terry No. 902 (c. 36-year-old, male, died of pulmonary TB) very likely represents the articular and anterior subligamentous types. The vertebral lesions recorded in the skeleton of Terry No. 1124R (49-year-old, female, died of pulmonary TB) are suggestive of the paradiscal form with multilevel noncontiguous involvement. Our paper provides palaeopathologists with a stronger basis for identifying tuberculosis in ancient human remains that reveal unusual vertebral alterations resembling that of our cases and, therefore, with a more sensitive means of assessing TB prevalence in past populations.}

There was insufficient material to permit re-examination of all of the original samples. The earlier results were confirmed in two independent laboratories using different methodologies.

In the study of beverages prepared at home, data on caffeine concentrations in 58 samples of tea and coffee, volumes of cups, and numbers of cups consumed/day, indicated that the range of caffeine intakes for the women participating was 49-1022 mg/day. There were considerable day-to-day variations in caffeine contents in coffee samples from some commercial coffee shops. When 17 samples of five national brands of instant coffee were made into beverages in the laboratory, variations in caffeine concentrations between lots were small but between brands were significant. A considerable range of caffeine concentrations was also found when 12 samples of coffee prepared at work by different individuals using the same jar of instant coffee were analysed. Analysis of tea samples prepared in the laboratory indicated that steeping time had an important influence on resulting caffeine and theobromine concentrations. People preparing their own beverages were found to drink more liquid than the volume offered commercially. The mean caffeine 'contents' of home-made coffee and of coffee prepared by individuals at work were 79.4 and 81.7mg/cup respectively, indicating a mean intake of approximately 80mg caffeine/cup. When this amount (80 mg/cup) was used to estimate daily intakes of caffeine from coffee, on the basis of the number of reported cups/day, and the values obtained were compared with the amounts actually consumed by individuals, the potential for misrepresentation of individual consumption became obvious. For example, for subjects consuming three cups of coffee, only 25\% would have been correctly categorized in the expected range for the daily intake of caffeine, 39\% would have been overestimated and 36\% underestimated for the amount of caffeine consumed. These variations in caffeine concentrations and in the volume of coffee consumed have frequently been ignored in examinations of the possible relationship between coffee consumption and various health problems, and this could perhaps partly explain some conflicting results seen in epidemiological studies.},

  abstract = {The tolerance of microorganisms in biofilms to antimicrobial agents is examined through a meta-analysis of literature data. A numerical tolerance factor comparing the rates of killing in the planktonic and biofilm states is defined to provide a quantitative basis for the analysis. Tolerance factors for biocides and antibiotics range over three orders of magnitude. This variation is not explained by taking into account the molecular weight of the agent, the chemistry of the agent, the substratum material, or the speciation of the microorganisms. Tolerance factors do depend on the areal cell density of the biofilm at the time of treatment and on the age of the biofilm as grown in a particular experimental system. This suggests that there is something that happens during biofilm maturation, either physical or physiological, that is essential for full biofilm tolerance. Experimental measurements of antimicrobial penetration times in biofilms range over orders of magnitude, with slower penetration ({$>$}12 min) observed for reactive oxidants and cationic molecules. These agents are retarded through the interaction of reaction, sorption, and diffusion. The specific physiological status of microbial cells in a biofilm contributes to antimicrobial tolerance. A conceptual framework for categorizing physiological cell states is discussed in the context of antimicrobial susceptibility. It is likely that biofilms harbor cells in multiple states simultaneously (e.g., growing, stress-adapted, dormant, inactive) and that this physiological heterogeneity is an important factor in the tolerance of the biofilm state.}

One way that a biofilm infection persists is by withstanding the flow of fluid or other mechanical forces that work to wash or sweep microorganisms out of the body. The fundamental criterion for mechanical persistence is that the biofilm failure strength exceeds the external applied stress. Mechanical failure of the biofilm and release of planktonic microbial cells is also important in vivo because it can result in dissemination of infection. The fundamental criterion for detachment and dissemination is that the applied stress exceeds the biofilm failure strength. The apparent contradiction for a biofilm to both persist and disseminate is resolved by recognizing that biofilm material properties are inherently heterogeneous. There are also mechanical aspects to the ways that infectious biofilms evade leukocyte phagocytosis. The possibility of alternative therapies for treating biofilm infections that work by reducing biofilm cohesion could (1) allow prevailing hydrodynamic shear to remove biofilm, (2) increase the efficacy of designed interventions for removing biofilms, (3) enable phagocytic engulfment of softened biofilm aggregates, and (4) improve phagocyte mobility and access to biofilm.},

The sample is composed of skeletons of 104 whites and 88 blacks from the Dart and Pretoria collections. Six humeral dimensions were initially analyzed using stepwise discriminant function statistics. Humeral head diameter, deltoid tuberosity circumference and epicondylar breadth were individually calculated in order to make the technique usable for fragmented remains. The results indicated that the head and epicondylar diameters are the best in whites to differentiate sexes from each other, while head diameter and maximum length are best in blacks. Accuracy of correct classification was as high as 96\% in whites and 95\% in blacks. Crossvalidation provided the same accuracy as the original classification. These accuracy percentages are as high as those expected from the femur and tibia. Posterior probability, which measures the percent affiliation of the sample with its original sex group, was also mostly 80\% or better. South African collections are ideal for osteometric analysis, because they are still growing in numbers with cross-sectional representatives from the country.},

Tuberculosis is one of the most studied diseases and still remains a major health problem today. Its manifestations in past populations have been extensively described, but less is known about its bony involvement in the post-antibiotic era. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency and manifestations of skeletal lesions in the post-antibiotic era in a South African sample and compare it to that found before the introduction of antibiotics. Skeletons of 205 individuals from modern skeletal collections and who are known to have died from TB were assessed. It was found that 39.2\% of all individuals dying in the post-antibiotic era showed skeletal changes that could be associated with TB, while another 27.5\% showed nonspecific changes. The highest incidences were found in individuals who died after 1985, when co-infection with HIV and drug resistance became common. While, as expected, vertebral and rib changes were the most common, the number of individuals who showed changes to the skull, and specifically intracranially, was surprising. These could most probably be associated with TB meningitis, although this specific cause of death was noted in only a few individuals. It seems that individuals may be living longer as a result of long-term antibiotic use, leaving more time for lesions to develop. Clin.

A corollary to this statement is that working with data necessitates collaboration. Although students often learn technical workflows to wrangle and analyze data, these workflows may break down or require adjustment to accommodate the different stages of the writing process when it is time to face the communication phase of the project. In this paper, I propose two writing workflows for use by students in a final-project setting. One workflow involves version control and aims to minimize the chance of a merge conflict throughout the writing process, and the other aims to add some level of reproducibility to a Google-Doc-heavy writing workflow (i.e., avoid manual copying and pasting). Both rely on a division of the labor, require a plan (and structure) to be created and followed by members of a team, and involve communication outside of the final report document itself. This paper does not aim to solve all collaborative writing pain points but instead aims to start the conversation on how to explicitly teach students not only how to code collaboratively but to write collaboratively.},

The aim is to address the question of whether growth and development data of non-survivors are reflective of the biological consequences of selective mortality and/or stress. Materials and Methods The study compares dental development and skeletal growth collected from radiographic images of contemporary samples of living and deceased individuals from the United States (birth to 20 years) and South Africa (birth to 12 years). Further evaluation of deceased individuals is used to explore differential patterns among manners of death (MOD). Results Results do not show any significant differences in skeletal growth or dental development between living and deceased individuals. However, in the South African deceased sample the youngest individuals exhibited substantially smaller diaphyseal lengths than the living sample, but by 2 years of age the differences were negligible. In the US sample, neither significant nor substantial differences were found in dental development or diaphyseal length according to MOD and age ({$>$}2 years of age), though some long bones in individuals {$<$}2 years of age did show significant differences. No significant differences were noted in diaphyseal length according to MOD and age in the SA sample. Discussion The current findings refute the idea that contemporary deceased and living individuals would present with differential growth and development patterns through all of ontogeny as well as the assumptions linking short stature, poor environments, and MOD.},

A radiographic sample amassed from Erie County Medical Examiner's office includes 85 femoral and 45 humeral images for analysis in relation to sex. Measurements for lengths and breadths were collected through tpsDig software. Discriminant analysis proved to be the most successful method, with error rates of 3\% when utilizing maximum breadth at midshaft of the femur and 11\% with humerus maximum distal breadth.

A UPLC/QTof-MS-based metabolomics study was employed to analyze metabolic alterations in oral bacterium, Capnocytophaga sputigena as a result of smokeless tobacco exposure and to assess the capability of the bacterium to metabolize nicotine. Pathway analysis of the metabolome profiles indicated that smokeless tobacco extracts caused oxidative stress in the bacterium. The metabolomics data also showed that the arginine-nitric oxide pathway was perturbed by the smokeless tobacco treatment. Results also showed that LC/MS was useful in identifying STP constituents and additives, including caffeine and many flavoring compounds. No significant changes in levels of nicotine and its major metabolites were found when C. sputigena was cultured in a nutrient rich medium, although hydroxylnicotine and cotinine N-oxide were detected in the bacterial metabolites suggesting that nicotine metabolism might be present as a minor degradation pathway in the bacterium. Study results provide new insights regarding the physiological and toxicological effects of smokeless tobacco on oral bacterium C. sputigena and associated oral health as well as measuring the ability of the oral bacterium to metabolize nicotine.},

The main causative agents of tuberculosis worldwide are Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) and M. bovis, along with M. africanum, M. cenettii and M. microti; these species make up the `M. tuberculosis complex'. This worldwide infection has been of special interest to palaeopathologists due to its characteristic bone lesions as well as its great antiquity. Historically, tuberculosis has been recognised in Japan for more than a thousand years. However, the origin and early prevalence of tuberculosis remain unknown. In the present study, we present the earliest evidence of skeletal tuberculosis found in the Aneolithic Yayoi period in Japan (ca. 300 BC to AD 300). The skeletal remains showing typical pathological changes of spinal tuberculosis were dated to between 454 BC and AD 124 by dendrochronological methods using coburied arrow-shield board and house columns made of Japanese cedar. We discuss the early prevalence of this infectious disease and its influence on the population history of the Japanese from prehistoric to Aneolithic times.

Recently, this laboratory reported that proteolipids from the calcifying bacterium, Bacterionema matruchotii, act as an ionophore when reconstituted into bacteriorhodopsin-proteoliposomes. This ionophoric activity is blocked by [               14               C] dicyclohexylcarbodiimide ([               14               C]DCCD). SDS-PAGE shows that [               14               C]DCCD binds to a single band of Mr 8500. To determine whether proteins other than the [               14               C]DCCD-binding protein are involved, we examined the function of proteolipid species extracted by solvents of differing polarity. Proteolipids were isolated independently from chloroform:methanol (2:1) and chloroform:methanol:HCl (200:100:1) extracts of the bacteria by Sephadex LH-20 chromatography and were electrophoresed on 12.5\% acrylamide gels. The chloroform:methanol extract contained a major band at Mr 10,000 that was not present in gels of proteolipid isolated by acidified solvent. Proteolipids extracted in chloroform:methanol:HCl included a broad band at Mr 8500, which co-migrated with the [               14               C] DCCD-binding protein. The rate and extent of proton translocation were not altered when either proteolipid extract was added individually to bacteriorhodopsin proteoliposomes. However, when proteolipids isolated from the chloroform:methanol and chloroform:methanol:HCl extracts were combined, the rate and extent of translocation were increased. These data demonstrate that at least two proteolipid proteins are necessary for ionophoric activity, the Mr 10,000 protein isolated by chloroform:methanol 2:1 and the [               14               C]DCCD-binding protein requiring acidified solvent for extraction.},

In many of these problem domains, the row\textendash column space structure of a low rank matrix carries information about some underlying phenomenon, and it is of interest in inferential settings to evaluate the extent to which the row\textendash column spaces of an estimated low rank matrix signify discoveries about the phenomenon. However, in contrast with variable selection, we lack a formal framework to assess true or false discoveries in low rank estimation; in particular, the key source of difficulty is that the standard notion of a discovery is a discrete notion that is ill suited to the smooth structure underlying low rank matrices. We address this challenge via a geometric reformulation of the concept of a discovery, which then enables a natural definition in the low rank case. We describe and analyse a generalization of the stability selection method of Meinshausen and B\"uhlmann to control for false discoveries in low rank estimation, and we demonstrate its utility compared with previous approaches via numerical experiments.},

This review aims to summarize our current understanding of the metabolism of the oral microbiome. Saccharolytic bacteria?including Streptococcus, Actinomyces, and Lactobacillus species?degrade carbohydrates into organic acids via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway and several of its branch pathways, resulting in dental caries, while alkalization and acid neutralization via the arginine deiminase system, urease, and so on, counteract acidification. Proteolytic/amino acid?degrading bacteria, including Prevotella and Porphyromonas species, break down proteins and peptides into amino acids and degrade them further via specific pathways to produce short-chain fatty acids, ammonia, sulfur compounds, and indole/skatole, which act as virulent and modifying factors in periodontitis and oral malodor. Furthermore, it is suggested that ethanol-derived acetaldehyde can cause oral cancer, while nitrate-derived nitrite can aid caries prevention and systemic health. Microbial metabolic activity is influenced by the oral environment; however, it can also modify the oral environment, enhance the pathogenicity of bacteria, and induce microbial selection to create more pathogenic microbiome. Taking a metabolomic approach to analyzing the oral microbiome is crucial to improving our understanding of the functions of the oral microbiome.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate the viability of bacteria within these areas. Methods: Supragingival calculus harvested from patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis was immediately frozen to \textendash 70\textdegree C. Six samples were cryosectioned, stained with a bacterial viability kit, and examined with fluorescence microscopy. Controls comprised heat treatment of cryosections prior to staining. Four additional samples were stained and examined whole a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). Nine additional samples were prepared for bacterial culture, after initial irradiation with ultraviolet light to kill viable organisms on the covering plaque layer. Test samples were crushed to expose internal bacteria, while two controls were used without crushing. Results: Viable bacteria, as identified using the bacterial viability stain, were found within cavities/lacunae in supragingival calculus cryosections. Similar results were obtained from whole calculus samples using CLSM. Of the nine experimental samples where bacterial culture was attempted, five provided positive bacterial culture under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions; one showed positive growth under aerobic conditions only; while one showed no bacterial growth. The controls showed no bacterial growth. Conclusions: From this study, it appears that viable aerobic and anaerobic bacteria may be present within supragingival calculus, specifically within the internal channels and lacunae. Clinically, this may be important, since incomplete removal of supragingival calculus may expose these reservoirs of possible pathogenic bacteria and be a factor in the recurrence of periodontal diseases after treatment.

  abstract = {Introduction: Though dental calculus is generally recognised as comprising mineralised bacteria, areas of non-mineralised bacteria may be present. Aim: To investigate the ultrastructure of non-decalcified young and mature supragingival calculus and subgingival calculus, and the possible presence of internal viable bacteria. Materials and methods: Supragingival calculus was harvested from five patients, 9\textendash 10 weeks after scaling and root debridement. Five samples of mature supragingival and subgingival calculus were taken from patients presenting with adult periodontitis. Specimens were fixed and embedded for transmission electron microscopy. Results: The ultrastructure of young and mature supragingival calculus was similar with various large and small crystal types. Non-mineralised channels were observed extending into the calculus, often joining extensive lacunae, both containing intact non-mineralised coccoid and rod-shaped microorganisms. Subgingival calculus possessed more uniform mineralisation without non-mineralised channels and lacunae. Conclusion: Supragingival calculus contains non-mineralised areas which contain bacteria and other debris. The viability of the bacteria, and their identification could not be determined in this preliminary investigation. As viable bacteria within these lacunae may provide a source of re-infection, further work needs to be done to identify the bacteria in the lacunae, and to determine their viability.},

However, when and how wheat came to be a staple crop in China is still unclear. Stable isotope data from some archaeological sites suggested that the dietary change from C4 based diet to C3/C4 mixed diet occurred during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770\textendash 221 BC) on the Central Plains of China. However, the role of each C3 crop (wheat, rice and soybean) in human diet is not well understood in this key period. Some scholars have argued that wheat made the biggest contribution to human diet among the C3 crops. To further investigate the dietary role of wheat and agricultural economy in the Eastern Zhou on the Central Plains of China, combined methods of stable isotope analysis on human bones and starch grain analysis on human dental calculus were conducted at Laodaojing cemetery during the Warring States period. The mean {$\delta$}13C values (-14.7 {$\pm$} 2\textperthousand, n = 24) and mean {$\delta$}15N values (9.1 {$\pm$} 0.9\textperthousand, n = 24) of individuals from Laodaojing cemetery suggest that Laodaojing humans had a reliance on the mixture of C3/C4 foods and a certain proportion of animal protein was consumed. Given that the small elevation of {$\delta$}15N values ({$<$}3\textperthousand ) of Laodaojing humans, the contribution of domesticated animals to the mixed C3/C4 diet of Laodaojing population is relatively limited. Combined with starch grains extracted from human dental calculus, we argue that C3 and C4 foods at Laodaojing were mainly derived from wheat and millets respectively. Temporal investigations of stable isotope data and archaeobotanical evidences from the late Longshan period to Eastern Zhou Dynasty show the importance of wheat increased in agricultural economy slowly since its introduction into the Central Plains of China. Until the Eastern Zhou Dynasty, wheat as a C3 crop played an important dietary role in human diet of the Central Plains. A transformation from millet-based to millets/wheat-based agricultural economy occurred along with the shift of dietary pattern during this period.},

  abstract = {It has been suggested that the fossil Neandertal from La Chapelle-aux-Saints was so toothless that he would have had to have his food pre-chewed or otherwise prepared for him. This has also led to the inference that a high level of altruistic social behavior was characteristic of Neandertals. This appears to be in keeping with a current trend among anthropologists to upgrade the cultural and evolutionary status of Neandertals. Close examination of the recovered teeth and the condition of the alveoli indicates that the ``old man'' of La Chapelle-aux-Saints had upper and lower incisor, canine and premolar teeth on the left side intact and probably in occlusion, and that the same was true of these teeth in the right maxilla. Mandibular incisors, canine, and first premolar had probably been lost to a tumor or abscessing on the right side, but this pathology may have developed near the time of death. The right mandibular second premolar was probably functional, although tilted similarly to the intact premolar on the left. It is very unlikely that the individual was unable to chew food. The dentition thus gives no reliable evidence of altruistic behavior by his cohorts. This study may also relate to hypotheses concerning the ancestry of anatomically modern humans.}

In addition, chemical effects of the organic surface layer, i.e. plaque and pellicle, were also investigated. Methods The present study was conducted using several techniques: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results From XPS-measurements, it was found that exposure to alkaline solutions resulted in a massive removal of carbon from the tooth surface, and that the addition of surfactants increased the rate under present conditions. Based on the results from the FTIR-analysis, no substitution reactions between phosphate, carbonate and hydroxide ions in the enamel apatite could be detected. From a minor SEM-analysis, degradation and loss of substance of the enamel surface was found for the exposed samples. From XRD-analysis, no changes in crystallinity of the enamel apatite could be found between the samples. Conclusions The findings in this study show that exposure to alkaline solutions results in a degradation of enamel surfaces very dissimilar from acidic erosion. No significant erosion or chemical substitution of the apatite crystals themselves could be discerned. However, significant loss of organic carbon at the enamel surface was found in all exposed samples. The degradation of the protective organic layer at the enamel surface may profoundly increase the risk for caries and dental erosion from acidic foods and beverages.},

A control vertebra from the same period (1350\textendash 1538ad) from an individual with bone lesions characteristic of syphilis was negative. Against a background of partially degraded DNA, nested PCR was found to be superior for detecting tuberculosis bacterial sequences compared with reamplification of first-round products or modification of other PCR stages. DNA survival in bone was assessed using PCR for a human-specific region of theAlurepetitive short interspersed nucleotide elements (SINES) and the ability to amplify a single copy gene. Genomic DNA was found in all bones examined but the single copy gene did not amplify from the vertebra weakly positive for tuberculosis or the control. This may represent relatively poor DNA preservation in these samples. These findings corroborate the use of PCR as an aid in the study of infectious disease in ancient bone samples and stress the importance of assessing native DNA survival.},

We observed that statements of data availability upon (reasonable) request are inefficient and should not be allowed by journals. To improve data sharing at the time of manuscript acceptance, researchers should be better motivated to release their data with real benefits such as recognition, or bonus points in grant and job applications. We recommend that data management costs should be covered by funding agencies; publicly available research data ought to be included in the evaluation of applications; and surveillance of data sharing should be enforced by both academic publishers and funders.

Native starch is digested (i.e. hydrolysed) slowly compared with processed (gelatinised) starch whose crystallinity has been lost and where the accessibility of substrate to enzymes is greater and not restricted by {$\alpha$}-glucan associations such as double helices (especially in crystallites) or amylose-lipid complexes (in cereal starches). The restriction of starch digestion (primarily in the human digestive system) due to forms which are resistant to hydrolysis has led to the concept of dietary `resistant-starch'. Different forms of resistance can be identified which hinder hydrolysis. With regard to digestibility, whether in the human or animal digestive tract, it is important to understand the mechanisms of enzymatic hydrolysis, and the consequence of incomplete digestion i.e. the potential loss of glucose as a valuable source of energy. This review deals with starch hydrolysis by specific amylases in model (in vitro) and more broadly in in vivo systems. The optimisation of starch hydrolysis and digestion is discussed in the light of modern knowledge.},

  abstract = {Background: From an ecological viewpoint, the oral cavity, in fact the oro-pharynx, is an `open growth system'. It undergoes an uninterrupted introduction and removal of both microorganisms and nutrients. In order to survive within the oro-pharyngeal area, bacteria need to adhere either to the soft or hard tissues in order to resist shear forces. The fast turn-over of the oral lining epithelia (shedding 3 \texttimes/day) is an efficient defence mechanism as it prevents the accumulation of large masses of microorganisms. Teeth, dentures, or endosseous implants, however, providing non-shedding surfaces, allow the formation of thick biofilms. In general, the established biofilm maintains an equilibrium with the host. An uncontrolled accumulation and/or metabolism of bacteria on the hard surfaces forms, however, the primary cause of dental caries, gingivitis, periodontitis, peri-implantitis, and stomatitis. Objectives: This systematic review aimed to evaluate critically the impact of surface characteristics (free energy, roughness, chemistry) on the de novo biofilm formation, especially in the supragingival and to a lesser extent in the subgingival areas. Methods: An electronic Medline search (from 1966 until July 2005) was conducted applying the following search items: `biofilm formation and dental/oral implants/surface characteristics', `surface characteristics and implants', `biofilm formation and oral', `plaque/biofilm and roughness', `plaque/biofilm and surface free energy', and `plaque formation and implants'. Only clinical studies within the oro-pharyngeal area were included. Results: From a series of split-mouth studies, it could be concluded that both an increase in surface roughness above the Ra threshold of 0.2{$\mu$}m and/or of the surface-free energy facilitates biofilm formation on restorative materials. When both surface characteristics interact with each other, surface roughness was found to be predominant. The biofilm formation is also influenced by the type (chemical composition) of biomaterial or the type of coating. Direct comparisons in biofilm formation on different transmucosal implant surfaces are scars. Conclusions: Extrapolation of data from studies on different restorative materials seems to indicate that transmucosal implant surfaces with a higher surface roughness/surface free energy facilitate biofilm formation.},

In contrast to blood, whole saliva is a non-sterile body fluid. Proper hand-ling and storage are required to preserve the integrity of potential biomarkers. We investigated salivary autoproteolytic degradation using a variety of approaches. We determined inhibition of protease activities by monitoring the endogenous proteome. In addition, the stability of highly protease-susceptible proteins-histatin 5, statherin, and PRP1-was assessed. Experimental variables included (a) protease inhibitors, (b) salivary pH, (c) incubation temperatures, and (d) sample heating. A cocktail containing AEBSF, aprotinin, pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, leupeptin, antipain, and EDTA could not prevent histatin 5, statherin, or PRP1 degradation in whole saliva. Among the other treatments evaluated, short-term storage of freshly collected samples on ice was effective without interfering with the chemistry of the proteome. In conclusion, whole saliva contains a unique mixture of enzymes as evidenced from their resilience to protease inhibition. Analytical evidence on protein stability is needed to ensure the validity of salivary biomarker study outcomes.

  abstract = {More than 700 bacterial species have been detected in the human oral cavity. They form highly organized microbial communities and are responsible for many oral infectious diseases, such as dental caries and periodontal disease. The prevention and treatment of these diseases require a comprehensive knowledge of oral microbial communities, which largely relies on culture-dependent methods to provide detailed phenotypic and physiological analysis of these communities. However, most of the currently available laboratory media can only selectively support the growth of a limited number of bacterial species within these communities, and fail to sustain the original oral microbial diversity. In this study, using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) as an index to systematically survey and analyse the selectivity of commonly used laboratory media, we developed a new medium (SHI medium) by combining the ingredients of several selected media that can support different subpopulations within the original oral microbial community derived from pooled saliva. DGGE and 454 pyrosequencing analysis showed that SHI medium was capable of supporting a more diversified community with a microbial profile closer to that of the original oral microbiota. Furthermore, 454 pyrosequencing revealed that SHI medium supported the growth of many oral species that have not before been cultured. Crystal violet assay and the confocal laser scanning microscope analysis indicated that, compared with other media, SHI medium is able to support a more complex saliva-derived biofilm with higher biomass yield and more diverse species. This DGGE-guided method could also be used to develop novel media for other complex microbial communities.},

  abstract = {This study aims to assess changes in the diet of individuals from Radom (Poland) by applying odontological and physicochemical methods. We evaluated the intensity of dental caries and quality of diet through isotope analyses ({$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N). Three consecutive time periods were selected: the early Medieval (EMP, 11th to 12th c.), late Medieval/early Modern (LMP, 14th to 17th c.) and Modern (MP, 18th to19th c.) periods. The dental remains of 247 adult individuals comprising a total of 3,850 permanent teeth were analysed. The intensity of dental caries increased in subsequent historical periods (EMP 38\%, LMP 47\% and MP 47\%). The lowest proportion of terrestrial C3 diet was noted in the oldest EMP population. The LMP and MP were similar in terms of the type of diet. The proportion of the terrestrial C3 component of the diet was 82\% and 79\% for LMP and MP, respectively. It can be supposed that the EMP population had such a varied diet that cariogenic products (e.g., cereals) were not the basic source of food, thus slowing down the development of dental caries. Later, there was a clear increase in the cariogenic factor(s) between the EMP and LMP, and this may have been related to the intensification of agricultural production.},

Probiotics (principally lactic acid bacteria; LAB) may assist in lowering the risk of these diseases. Experimental studies with probiotics have given generally inconclusive outcomes for infectious disease and for biomarkers for non-infectious disease. In part this situation may reflect their inability to colonise the adult human gut effectively. Prebiotics can assist in promoting colonisation, and resistant starch (RS), as a high-amylose starch, is a prebiotic and synbiotic. This starch exerts its synbiotic action through adhesion of the bacteria to the granule surface. Consumption of RS assists in recovery from infectious diarrhoea in man and animals. A rice porridge, high in RS, appears to modify the autochthonous porcine large-bowel microflora favourably through lowering Escherichia coli and coliform numbers. Many of the beneficial effects of RS on large-bowel function appear to beexerted through short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) formed by bacterial fermentation. In man LAB are found in relatively highest numbers in milk-fed infants where theprofile of fermentation products differs quite markedly from that in adults. It appearsunlikely that ingestion of current probiotics will alter either total SCFA or the proportions of the major acids. More emphasis needs to be given to the investigation of the effects of complex carbohydrates, including RS, on the autochthonous microflora of the human large bowel.},

In this study, chipping data in the teeth of Homo naledi are compared with those of other pertinent dental samples to give insight into their etiology. Permanent teeth with complete crowns evidencing occlusal wear were examined macroscopically. The location, number, and severity of fractures were recorded and compared to those found in samples of two other South African fossil hominin species and in samples of nonhuman primates (n = 3) and recent humans (n = 7). With 44\% of teeth affected, H. naledi exhibits far higher rates of chipping than the other fossil hominin samples. Specifically, 50\% of posterior teeth and 31\% of anterior teeth display at least one chip. The maxillary teeth are more affected than the mandibular teeth (45\% vs 43\%, respectively), 73\% of molar chipping occurs on interproximal surfaces, and right teeth are more often affected than left teeth (50\% vs 38\%). Results indicate that the teeth of H. naledi were exposed to acute trauma on a regular basis. Because interproximal areas are more affected than buccal and posterior teeth more than anterior, it is unlikely that nonmasticatory cultural behavior was the cause. A diet containing hard and resistant food, or contaminants such as grit, is more likely. The small chip size, and steep occlusal wear and cupped dentine on some molars are supportive of the latter possibility. This pattern of chipping suggests that H. naledi differed considerably\textemdash in terms of diet, environment, and/or specialized masticatory processing\textemdash relative to other African fossil hominins.}

The unobscured starch grains recovered are consistent with descriptions of modern reference samples of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas). These results indicate the importance of sweet potato to the Rapanui diet prior to European contact in 1722. The analysis of modern sweet potato skins show that they incorporate phytoliths as they grow in phytolith rich sediment, and we argue that the high frequency of palm phytoliths recovered from dental calculus, in conjunction with our starch results points to the consumption of sweet potato.},

Dental calculus is a mineralised biofilm that forms on the surface of teeth, with the potential to encase anything that comes into contact with the mouth. Dental calculus has provided information on the lifeways of past people including diet, health, disease, trade and fabrication. To extract this microarchaeological information from dental calculus it must first be processed, either mechanically (with a mortar and pestle) or chemically (generally with hydrochloric acid or HCl), in order to free the microparticles and biomolecular structures encased within. Until now, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) has not been used for microparticle extraction. Here we present data that demonstrate EDTA is an equally and potentially more effective decalcifying agent for extracting microparticles than previous methods using samples from the Southwest Pacific and Ireland.

Sharing and interacting with these digital representations is essential in fostering engagement and ensuring that research is relevant to the broader community.

However, archaeologists are faced with a variety of challenges when sharing 3D models of human remains online, including metadata curation, accessibility, openness, copyright as well as the ethical implications of sharing digital bioarchaeological data and long-term storage requirements. In this research, metadata from a collection of 3D models of human remains were extracted from SketchFab and analysed to understand how users share 3D models of human remains via online social platforms. The results were contrasted with a critical review of current ethical and technical guidelines, indicating potentially ethically compromising practices, particularly the lack of contextualising metadata for some models. This article proposes and discusses recommendations for developing more strategic approaches to the sharing of 3D data on human remains online, such as assessing and agreeing hosting, licensing and metadata management during project design. Frameworks are provided to support these approaches and make decisions on how to share data openly.},

Abstract Aim: To monitor microbial shifts during dental biofilm re-development. Materials and methods: Supra- and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28 teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects at baseline and immediately after tooth cleaning. Samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants during 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of no oral hygiene. Samples were analysed using checkerboard DNA\textendash DNA hybridization. Species counts were averaged within subjects at each time point. Significant differences in the counts between healthy and periodontitis subjects were determined using the Mann\textendash Whitney test. Results: The total supra- and subgingival counts were significantly higher in periodontitis on entry and reached or exceeded the baseline values after day 2. Supragingival counts of Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii and Neisseria mucosa increased from 2 to 7 days. Subgingival counts were greater for Actinomyces, green and orange complex species. Significant differences between groups in supragingival counts occurred for 17 of 41 species at entry, 0 at day 7; for subgingival plaque, these values were 39/41 taxa at entry, 17/41 at day 7. Conclusions: Supragingival plaque re-development was similar in periodontitis and health, but subgingival species recolonization was more marked in periodontitis.},

Experiments were performed to elucidate the interactions of streptococcal glucosyltransferase (Gtf) enzymes with human salivary {$\alpha$}-amylase in solution and on the surface of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (SHA) beads. The Gtf enzymes -B, -C and -C, when immobilized on to SHA beads, reduced the activity of adsorbed amylase; GtfD showed the highest inhibition of salivary amylase activity. The presence of glucan produced by immobilized GtfD did not further reduce amylase activity. The amount of amylase adsorbed on to hydroxyapatite beads was reduced when salivary amylase was added simultaneously with any of the Gtf enzymes, suggesting that amylase and Gtfs may compete with each other for binding sites on hydroxyapatite. Starch hydrolysates produced by SHA-surface-bound salivary amylase were tested for their effect on glucan production from sucrose by Gtf enzymes in solution and on SHA beads; glucan production by SHA-immobilized GtfB was stimulated in the presence of starch hydrolysates. Glucan synthesized by SHA-immobilized GtfB in the presence of starch hydrolysates was less susceptible to hydrolysis by the fungal enzyme mutanase than was glucan made by SHA-immobilized GtfB in the absence of starch hydrolysates. Glucan production by GtfB associated with streptococci immobilized on to SHA was also enhanced in the presence of starch hydrolysates. The adhesion of oral micro-organisms to SHA coated with glucan made in the presence and absence of starch hydrolysates was investigated, and some bacteria displayed higher adhesion activities for the glucan made in the presence of the hydrolysates. Therefore, the interaction of amylase and Gtf enzymes on a SHA surface may modulate the formation of glucan and the adherence of oral micro-organisms.},

  abstract = {Indigenous populations of the Americas experienced high mortality rates during the early contact period as a result of infectious diseases, many of which were introduced by Europeans. Most of the pathogenic agents that caused these outbreaks remain unknown. Through the introduction of a new metagenomic analysis tool called MALT, applied here to search for traces of ancient pathogen DNA, we were able to identify Salmonella enterica in individuals buried in an early contact era epidemic cemetery at Teposcolula-Yucundaa, Oaxaca in southern Mexico. This cemetery is linked, based on historical and archaeological evidence, to the 1545\textendash 1550\,ce epidemic that affected large parts of Mexico. Locally, this epidemic was known as `cocoliztli', the pathogenic cause of which has been debated for more than a century. Here, we present genome-wide data from ten individuals for Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Paratyphi C, a bacterial cause of enteric fever. We propose that S.\,Paratyphi C be considered a strong candidate for the epidemic population decline during the 1545 cocoliztli outbreak at Teposcolula-Yucundaa.}

  abstract = {Collection of oral fluid (OF) is easy and non-invasive compared to the collection of urine and blood, and interest in OF for drug screening and diagnostic purposes is increasing. A high-throughput ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for determination of 21 drugs in OF using fully automated 96-well plate supported liquid extraction for sample preparation is presented. The method contains a selection of classic drugs of abuse, including amphetamines, cocaine, cannabis, opioids, and benzodiazepines. The method was fully validated for 200 {$\mu$}L OF/buffer mix using an Intercept OF sampling kit; validation included linearity, sensitivity, precision, accuracy, extraction recovery, matrix effects, stability, and carry-over. Inter-assay precision (RSD) and accuracy (relative error) were {$<$}15\% and 13 to 5\%, respectively, for all compounds at concentrations equal to or higher than the lower limit of quantification. Extraction recoveries were between 58 and 76\% (RSD {$<$} 8\%), except for tetrahydrocannabinol and three 7-amino benzodiazepine metabolites with recoveries between 23 and 33\% (RSD between 51 and 52 \% and 11 and 25\%, respectively). Ion enhancement or ion suppression effects were observed for a few compounds; however, to a large degree they were compensated for by the internal standards used. Deuterium-labelled and 13C-labelled internal standards were used for 8 and 11 of the compounds, respectively. In a comparison between Intercept and Quantisal OF kits, better recoveries and fewer matrix effects were observed for some compounds using Quantisal. The method is sensitive and robust for its purposes and has been used successfully since February 2015 for analysis of Intercept OF samples from 2600 cases in a 12-month period.

  abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance From 1640\textendash 1796, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) occupied the island of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Several VOC officers had a keen interest in the medicinal application of the local flora. The Leiden University Library holds a two-piece codex entitled: Icones Plantarum Malabaricarum, adscriptis nominibus et viribus, Vol. I. \& II. (Illustrations of Plants from the Malabar, assigned names and strength). This manuscript contains 262 watercolour drawings of medicinal plants from Sri Lanka, with handwritten descriptions of local names, habitus, medicinal properties and therapeutic applications. This anonymous document had never been studied previously. Aim of the study To identify all depicted plant specimens, decipher the text, trace the author, and analyse the scientific relevance of this manuscript as well as its importance for Sri Lankan ethnobotany. Materials and methods We digitised the entire manuscript, transcribed and translated the handwritten Dutch texts and identified the depicted species using historic and modern literature, herbarium vouchers, online databases on Sri Lankan herbal medicine and 41 botanical drawings by the same artist in the Artis library, Amsterdam. We traced the origin of the manuscript by means of watermark analysis and historical literature. We compared the historic Sinhalese and Tamil names in the manuscript to recent plant names in ethnobotanical references from Sri Lanka and southern India. We published the entire manuscript online with translations and identifications. Results The watermarks indicate that the paper was made between 1694 and 1718. The handwriting is of a VOC scribe. In total, ca. 252 taxa are depicted, of which we could identify 221 to species level. The drawings represent mainly native species, including Sri Lankan endemics, but also introduced medicinal and ornamental plants. Lamiaceae, Zingiberaceae and Leguminosae were the best-represented families. Frequently mentioned applications were to purify the blood and to treat gastro-intestinal problems, fever and snakebites. Many plants are characterised by their humoral properties, of which `warming' is the most prevalent. Plant species were mostly used for their roots (28\%), bark (16\%) or leaves (11\%). More Tamil names (260) were documented than Sinhalese (208). More than half of the Tamil names and 36\% of the Sinhalese names are still used today. The author was probably a VOC surgeon based in northern Sri Lanka, who travelled around the island to document medicinal plant use. Less than half of the species were previously documented from Ceylon by the famous VOC doctor and botanist Paul Hermann in the 1670s. Further archival research is needed to identify the maker of this manuscript. Conclusions Although the maker of this early 18th century manuscript remains unknown, the detailed, 300-year-old information on medicinal plant use in the Icones Plantarum Malabaricarum represents an important ethnobotanical treasure for Sri Lanka, which offers ample opportunities to study changes and continuation of medicinal plant names and practices over time.},

CSLM is a suitable technique to obtain, under mild conditions, 2D and 3D images of the granules. The samples for observation by CSLM do not require complicated preparations such as drying and metal coating as in the case of electron microscopy. Moreover, the CSLM technique is not limited to the observation of native starch granules, as the gelatinisation process and the remnants of granules in starch pastes can be monitored in their original environment.

Understanding biofilm community dynamics in continuous culture, and whether they maintain distinct signatures of health and disease, is necessary to determine the reliability and applicability of such models to broader studies. To this end, we performed next-generation sequencing on biofilms grown from healthy and disease-site subgingival plaque for 80~days to assess stability and reliability of continuous oral biofilm growth.},

While diet strongly influences stool microbiome composition, the influence of diet on the oral microbiome is largely speculative. Multiple ecologically distinct surfaces in the mouth, each harbouring a unique microbial community, pose a challenge to assessing changes in the oral microbiome in the context of industrialization, as the results depend on the oral site under study. Here, we investigated whether microbial communities of dental plaque, the dense biofilm on non-shedding tooth surfaces, are distinctly different across populations with dissimilar subsistence strategies and degree of industrialized market integration. Using a metagenomic approach, we compared the dental plaque microbiomes of Baka foragers and Nzime subsistence agriculturalists in Cameroon (n = 46) with the dental plaque and calculus microbiomes of highly industrialized populations in North America and Europe (n = 38). We found that differences in microbial taxonomic composition between populations were minimal, with high conservation of abundant microbial taxa and no significant differences in microbial diversity related to dietary practices. Instead, we find that the major source of variation in dental plaque microbial species composition is related to tooth location and oxygen availability, which may be influenced by toothbrushing or other dental hygiene measures. Our results support that dental plaque, in contrast to the stool microbiome, maintains an inherent stability against ecological perturbations in the oral environment.},

  abstract = {Background: Dental calculus, calcified oral plaque biofilm, contains microbial and host biomolecules that can be used to study historic microbiome communities and host responses. Dental calculus does not typically accumulate as much today as historically, and clinical oral microbiome research studies focus primarily on living dental plaque biofilm. However, plaque and calculus reflect different conditions of the oral biofilm, and the differences in microbial characteristics between the sample types have not yet been systematically explored. Here, we compare the microbial profiles of modern dental plaque, modern dental calculus, and historic dental calculus to establish expected differences between these substrates. Results: Metagenomic data was generated from modern and historic calculus samples, and dental plaque metagenomic data was downloaded from the Human Microbiome Project. Microbial composition and functional profile were assessed. Metaproteomic data was obtained from a subset of historic calculus samples. Comparisons between microbial, protein, and metabolomic profiles revealed distinct taxonomic and metabolic functional profiles between plaque, modern calculus, and historic calculus, but not between calculus collected from healthy teeth and periodontal disease-affected teeth. Species co-exclusion was related to biofilm environment. Proteomic profiling revealed that healthy tooth samples contain low levels of bacterial virulence proteins and a robust innate immune response. Correlations between proteomic and metabolomic profiles suggest co-preservation of bacterial lipid membranes and membrane-associated proteins. Conclusions: Overall, we find that there are systematic microbial differences between plaque and calculus related to biofilm physiology, and recognizing these differences is important for accurate data interpretation in studies comparing dental plaque and calculus.},

  abstract = {Metagenomics enables the study of complex microbial communities from myriad sources, including the remains of oral and gut microbiota preserved in archaeological dental calculus and paleofeces, respectively. While accurate taxonomic assignment is essential to this process, DNA damage characteristic of ancient samples (e.g., reduction in fragment size and cytosine deamination) may reduce the accuracy of read taxonomic assignment. Using a set of in silico-generated metagenomic data sets, we investigated how the addition of ancient DNA (aDNA) damage patterns influences microbial taxonomic assignment by five widely used profilers: QIIME/UCLUST, MetaPhlAn2, MIDAS, CLARK-S, and MALT. In silico-generated data sets were designed to mimic dental plaque, consisting of 40, 100, and 200 microbial species/strains, both with and without simulated aDNA damage patterns. Following taxonomic assignment, the profiles were evaluated for species presence/absence, relative abundance, alpha diversity, beta diversity, and specific taxonomic assignment biases. Unifrac metrics indicated that both MIDAS and MetaPhlAn2 reconstructed the most accurate community structure. QIIME/UCLUST, CLARK-S, and MALT had the highest number of inaccurate taxonomic assignments; false-positive rates were highest by CLARK-S and QIIME/UCLUST. Filtering out species present at {$<$}0.1\% abundance greatly increased the accuracy of CLARK-S and MALT. All programs except CLARK-S failed to detect some species from the input file that were in their databases. The addition of ancient DNA damage resulted in minimal differences in species detection and relative abundance between simulated ancient and modern data sets for most programs. Overall, taxonomic profiling biases are program specific rather than damage dependent, and the choice of taxonomic classification program should be tailored to specific research questions. IMPORTANCE Ancient biomolecules from oral and gut microbiome samples have been shown to be preserved in the archaeological record. Studying ancient microbiome communities using metagenomic techniques offers a unique opportunity to reconstruct the evolutionary trajectories of microbial communities through time. DNA accumulates specific damage over time, which could potentially affect taxonomic classification and our ability to accurately reconstruct community assemblages. It is therefore necessary to assess whether ancient DNA (aDNA) damage patterns affect metagenomic taxonomic profiling. Here, we assessed biases in community structure, diversity, species detection, and relative abundance estimates by five popular metagenomic taxonomic classification programs using in silico-generated data sets with and without aDNA damage. Damage patterns had minimal impact on the taxonomic profiles produced by each program, while false-positive rates and biases were intrinsic to each program. Therefore, the most appropriate classification program is one that minimizes the biases related to the questions being addressed.},

  abstract = {The structure of different starch gels made of native high-amylose maize starch, purified amylose polymers and waxy-maize starch was studied using dynamic viscoelastic measurements. In this study starch gels with high-amylose content had the most rigid structure followed by pure amylose and amylopectin gels. The addition of a high amount of maltitol to the high-amylose starch dispersion before heating reduced the formation of networks. The enzymatic digestibility of various starch gels was measured using both in vitro and in vivo methods. In 5min {$\alpha$}-amylase hydrolysis, the extent of degradation was decreased when the amylose concentration was increased in the amylose network and when maltitol syrup was added. Acid production from starch gels was followed in vivo by monitoring pH changes in approximal plaque. The correlation between minimum plaque pH and the extent of hydrolysis determined in vitro was relatively good. The amount of amylose in the network was not the factor that affected the extent of short-term oral enzymatic degradation. The more rigid the gel, the lower the extent of hydrolysis. However, even though high-amylose starch gels with a rigid structure were hydrolysed to a minor extent in salivary {$\alpha$}-amylase hydrolysis in vitro they did not induce any pH changes in human plaque.},

These policies are predicated on the idea that authors are poor stewards of their data, particularly over the long term [7], and indeed many studies have found that authors are often unable or unwilling to share their data [8, 9, 10, 11]. However, there are no systematic estimates of how the availability of research data changes with time since publication. We therefore requested data sets from a relatively homogenous set of 516 articles published between 2 and 22 years ago, and found that availability of the data was strongly affected by article age. For papers where the authors gave the status of their data, the odds of a data set being extant fell by 17\% per year. In addition, the odds that we could find a working e-mail address for the first, last, or corresponding author fell by 7\% per year. Our results reinforce the notion that, in the long term, research data cannot be reliably preserved by individual researchers, and further demonstrate the urgent need for policies mandating data sharing via public archives.},

It has been suggested that this red fluorescence is related to caries and the cariogenic potential of dental plaque. Recently, it was suggested that red fluorescence may be related to gingivitis. Little is known about green fluorescence from biofilms. Therefore, we assessed the dynamics of red and green fluorescence in real-time during biofilm formation. In addition, the fluorescence patterns of biofilm formed from saliva of eight different donors are described under simulated gingivitis and caries conditions. Biofilm formation was analysed for 12 hours under flow conditions in a microfluidic BioFlux flow system with high performance microscopy using a camera to allow live cell imaging. For fluorescence images dedicated excitation and emission filters were used. Both green and red fluorescence were linearly related with the total biomass of the biofilms. All biofilms displayed to some extent green and red fluorescence, with higher red and green fluorescence intensities from biofilms grown in the presence of serum (gingivitis simulation) as compared to the sucrose grown biofilms (cariogenic simulation). Remarkably, cocci with long chain lengths, presumably streptococci, were observed in the biofilms. Green and red fluorescence were not found homogeneously distributed within the biofilms: highly fluorescent spots (both green and red) were visible throughout the biomass. An increase in red fluorescence from the in vitro biofilms appeared to be related to the clinical inflammatory response of the respective saliva donors, which was previously assessed during an in vivo period of performing no-oral hygiene. The BioFlux model proved to be a reliable model to assess biofilm fluorescence. With this model, a prediction can be made whether a patient will be prone to the development of gingivitis or caries.},

This fact has important implications for dating and other analytical procedures involving bone, as well as faunal analysis where differential preservation of bones of different species may affect conclusions regarding the relative significance of an animal to the economy of a given society. The diagenic processes in bone range from minor changes in the bone protein to complete structural and chemical breakdown. Using fresh cow bone, we conducted laboratory experiments which simulate the effect of temperature and bone size on the rate and nature of bone disintegration in archaeological sites. Temperature influences the rate of chemical change, and bone size and density affect the accessibility of the molecular constituents of bone to extrinsic chemical reactions. These findings clarify the importance of two well-known concepts in bone taphonomy. (1) The rate of chemical breakdown in bone tissues is related to the proximity of a given unit of tissue to the bone surface. This means that, in archaeological bone samples, tissue near the surface may be different chemically from tissue away from the surface and great care is necessary in choosing and preparing bone samples for analytical procedures. (2) In general, small bones are not as well preserved as large bones, therefore small animals are likely to be underrepresented in faunal assemblages.},

METHODS We include the attempted use of a previously unreported methodology in proteome research, to remove the dominant bone collagens using bacterial collagenase as well as conventional shotgun proteomics methodology following digestion with the protease trypsin. In this study we expand upon a set of 19 bovine sub-fossil specimens ranging over one and a half million years that had previously been shown to possess collagen, using a total of 46 LTQ-Orbitrap liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analyses containing 462,186 precursor ion analyses. RESULTS Although many types of proteins can typically be identified in recent bone, in degraded bone we observe a rapid loss of lower abundance proteins. Abundant serum proteins such as serum albumin and alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein appear to be more easily recovered in ancient bone, both being identified in specimens dating to the Early Pleistocene, the earliest period tested in this study. Proteins belonging to the leucine-rich repeat family such as lumican, biglycan and chondroadherin also survive well, possibly because of their interactions with bone collagen. CONCLUSIONS Of these 'survivor proteins' A2HSG shows a remarkable amount of sequence variation, making it potentially one of the most useful proteins to study for species identification and phylogenetic inference in archaeological and palaeontological bone. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors.

Since the 1950s, chronic iron-deficiency anemia has been widely accepted as the probable cause of both conditions. Based on this proposed etiology, bioarchaeologists use the prevalence of these conditions to infer living conditions conducive to dietary iron deficiency, iron malabsorption, and iron loss from both diarrheal disease and intestinal parasites in earlier human populations. This iron-deficiency-anemia hypothesis is inconsistent with recent hematological research that shows iron deficiency per se cannot sustain the massive red blood cell production that causes the marrow expansion responsible for these lesions. Several lines of evidence suggest that the accelerated loss and compensatory over-production of red blood cells seen in hemolytic and megaloblastic anemias is the most likely proximate cause of porotic hyperostosis. Although cranial vault and orbital roof porosities are sometimes conflated under the term porotic hyperostosis, paleopathological and clinical evidence suggests they often have different etiologies. Reconsidering the etiology of these skeletal conditions has important implications for current interpretations of malnutrition and infectious disease in earlier human populations.

The medium permitted almost total recovery of F. nucleatum when compared with a nonselective medium and suppressed the recovery of most remaining species by nonselective medium and suppressed the recovery of most remaining species by 6 to 8 orders of magnitude. Microorganisms suppressed to a lesser degree included Selenomonas sputigena, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, and some strains of Peptostreptococcus. The distinct colonial morphology of F. nucleatum on CVE agar made differentiation relatively easy when contaminants were present.

Ordinal scores of these sexually dimorphic traits were used to compute sex determination discriminant functions. Linear, kth-nearest-neighbor, logistic, and quadratic discriminant analysis models were evaluated based on their capacity to minimize both misclassifications and sex biases in classification errors. Logistic regression discriminant analysis produced the best results: a logistic model containing all five cranial trait scores correctly classified 88\% of the modern skulls with a negligible sex bias of 0.1\%. Adding age at death, birth year, and population affinity to the model did not appreciably improve its performance. For the ancient Native American sample, the best logistic regression model assigned the correct pelvic sex to 78\% of the individuals with a sex bias of only 0.2\%. Similar cranial trait frequency distributions were found in same-sex comparisons of the modern African American, European American, and English samples. The sexual dimorphism of these modern people contrasts markedly with that of the ancient Native Americans. Because of such population differences, discriminant functions like those presented in this paper should be used with caution on populations other than those for which they were developed.

  abstract = {Burials provide valuable information to study social structures based on the assumption that burials and associated grave goods can represent social roles and relations in a society. To study social relationships, network analysis has been increasingly applied to archaeological data to infer interactions and relationships between entities. Statistical approaches to network analysis, such as exponential random graph models (ERGMs), provide a way to test hypotheses about dynamic processes of network formation. However, computational difficulties and sensitivity to uncertainties limit the application of ERGMs. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian framework on ERGMs that enables an efficient computational process, effective quantification of uncertainty, and robust model evaluation of network properties. We tested a hypothesis of social change relative to the arrival of Europeans by studying burial data from Kiwulan, an Iron Age site in northeastern Taiwan. The results indicate a transition among the burials from network ties based on ritual objects to wealth objects, and a more centralized structure with increased social differentiation after the European presence was established in the 17th century. Our case study demonstrates the effectiveness of Bayesian network analysis for archaeological data, and expands the use of burials in understanding the impacts of colonial presence on Indigenous groups in a pericolonial context.},

  abstract = {Aims: Isolation and characterization of nicotine-degrading bacteria with advantages suitable for the treatment of nicotine-contaminated water and soil and detection of their metabolites. Methods and Results: A novel nicotine-degrading bacterial strain was isolated from tobacco field soil. Based on morphological and physiochemical properties and sequence of 16S rDNA, the isolate was identified as Pseudomonas sp., designated as CS3. The optimal culture conditions of strain CS3 for nicotine degradation were 30\textdegree C and pH 7{$\cdot$}0. However, the strain showed broad pH adaptability with high nicotine-degrading activity between pH 6{$\cdot$}0 and 10{$\cdot$}0. Strain CS3 could decompose nicotine nearly completely within 24 h in liquid culture (1000 mg L-1 nicotine) or within 72 h in soil (1000\textendash 2500 mg kg-1 nicotine) and could endure up to 4000 mg L-1 nicotine in liquid media and 5000 mg kg-1 nicotine in soil. Degradation tests in flask revealed that the strain had excellent stability and high degradation activity during the repetitive degradation processes. Additionally, three intermediates, 3-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl) pyridine, 1-methyl-5-(3-pyridyl) pyrrolidine-2-ol and cotinine, were identified by GC/MS and NMR analyses. Conclusions: The isolate CS3 showed outstanding nicotine-degrading characteristics such as high degradation efficiency, strong substrate endurance, broad pH adaptability, and stability and persistence in repetitive degradation processes and may serve as an excellent candidate for applications in the bioaugmentation process to treat nicotine-contaminated water and soil. Also, detection of nicotine metabolites suggests that strain CS3 might decompose nicotine via a unique nicotine-degradation pathway. Significance and Impact of the Study: The advantage of applying the isolated strain lies in broad pH adaptability and stability and persistence in repetitive use, the properties previously less focused in other nicotine-degrading micro-organisms. The strain might decompose nicotine via a nicotine-degradation pathway different from those of other nicotine-utilizing Pseudomonas bacteria reported earlier, another highlight in this study.},

Humans have exploited animal milk as a food resource for at least 8500 years, but the origins, spread, and scale of dairying remain poorly understood. Indirect lines of evidence, such as lipid isotopic ratios of pottery residues, faunal mortality profiles, and lactase persistence allele frequencies, provide a partial picture of this process; however, in order to understand how, where, and when humans consumed milk products, it is necessary to link evidence of consumption directly to individuals and their dairy livestock. Here we report the first direct evidence of milk consumption, the whey protein beta-lactoglobulin (BLG), preserved in human dental calculus from the Bronze Age (ca. 3000 BCE) to the present day. Using protein tandem mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that BLG is a species-specific biomarker of dairy consumption, and we identify individuals consuming cattle, sheep, and goat milk products in the archaeological record. We then apply this method to human dental calculus from Greenland's medieval Norse colonies, and report a decline of this biomarker leading up to the abandonment of the Norse Greenland colonies in the 15(th) century CE.},

The differential diagnosis is based on the morphological and radiographic analysis of the teeth of these individuals, and gives rise to several possible pathological conditions, namely: regurgitation erosion, mottled enamel due to fluorosis, dentinogenesis imperfecta, amelogenesis imperfecta, and osteogenesis imperfecta. Of these, amelogenesis imperfecta remains the most probable cause for one individual, and although dentinogenesis imperfecta was considered for the other based on the morphological features, the final diagnosis was changed to the former based on accurate radiological evidence. Since there are only a few reported cases of these conditions in the osteoarchaeological literature, we find it to be interesting and important to report these two cases. The scarcity of reports in the palaeopathological literature, compared with the prevalence of these tooth structure anomalies in living populations, lead us to consider amelogenesis imperfecta and dentinogenesis imperfecta to be probably misdiagnosed, and hence under-reported.

We evaluated osteophyte formation in autopsied 225 bodies (138 males, 87 females) during 5 years, and statistically analyzed the integrated data. The following were statistically obtained for each sex: correlation coefficient, regression equation, standard error of estimate (SE) between the score at each part of the vertebral column and age, and between `osteophyte formation index' and age. In all the parts of the vertebra, there was a significant correlation between the score value and age. We recognized a significant correlation between `osteophyte formation index' (X) and age (Y), and regression lines were Y=37.90+12.07X (SE; 12.6 y.o.) in males and Y=36.67+18.64X (SE; 11.9 y.o.) in females.

Use and appreciation of kissing may therefore vary according to whether the environment places a premium on good health and partner investment. Here, we test for cultural variation (13 countries from six continents) in these behaviours/attitudes according to national health (historical pathogen prevalence) and both absolute (GDP) and relative wealth (GINI). Our data reveal that kissing is valued more in established relationships than it is valued during courtship. Also, consistent with the pair bonding hypothesis of the function of romantic kissing, relative poverty (income inequality) predicts frequency of kissing across romantic relationships. When aggregated, the predicted relationship between income inequality and kissing frequency (r\,=\,0.67, BCa 95\% CI[0.32,0.89]) was over five times the size of the null correlations between income inequality and frequency of hugging/cuddling and sex. As social complexity requires monitoring resource competition among large groups and predicts kissing prevalence in remote societies, this gesture may be important in the maintenance of long-term pair bonds in specific environments.},

  abstract = {Healthy periodontal tissues are essential to maintaining attachment, stability, and retention of teeth. The concept of `health' is problematic however and includes both physical and psycho-social characteristics. The challenge for bioarchaeologists is defining what physical expression begins to affect an individual's well-being. Here we apply a lifecourse approach to the measurement of periodontal tissue depth (CEJ-AC) at M1 in a prehistoric sample (N = 162) from the American Southwest to test the hypothesis that age and sex differences bear the greatest impact on the expression of periodontitis. CEJ-AC at M1 increased significantly (p\&lt;.001) across age stages from 1.5 {$\pm$}0.5mm (15-20yo) to 4.25 {$\pm$}0.25mm in the old age group (40-50yo). Occlusal surface wear and alveolar crest (AC) resorption were considerably variable (non-significant) between sexes; however, tooth loss at M1 is more than double among females compared to males in the final decades 40-50yo and 50-60yo. Results support the hypothesis that periodontal tissue loss differentially affects females across the lifecourse. Bacterial infection, chronic gingivitis, and bony resorption cause the physical symptoms of periodontal disease but may not be accompanied by pain or altered functionality. The outcome of the disease process is tooth loss, which can affect functionality and quality of life. Periodontal `health' is therefore best interpreted in bioarchaeological samples around the point that alveolar recession results in tooth loss and altered functionality.},

This analysis employs morphometrics, the measurement of skeletal landmarks, supported by historic documentation to explore the intersection between colonists' breed preferences and species translocation. In doing so, this analysis provides insight into the differential effects of human selective breeding on domestic dog's (Canis familiaris) physical characteristics in Native American and European societies. Historic sources suggest that European colonists selectively imported large dog breeds capable of defending settlements and livestock, acting as war dogs, and aiding hunters. Colonists' dogs are reputed to have been significantly larger than Native American dogs. This study compares standardised measurements taken on bones to estimate shoulder height. We find that dog populations in England and North America spanning the period 0\textendash 1,800 AD exhibit an almost identical average stature; however, the range of shoulder height variation in European dogs is far greater than seen in eastern Native American dog populations. Dogs in colonial American contexts are statistically larger than both Native American and European dog populations, supporting documentary accounts that colonists selectively imported breeds from the largest available in Europe.},

At birth, males have a similar fat mass to females but are longer and have greater lean mass. Such differences remain detectable during childhood; however, females enter puberty earlier and undergo a more rapid pubertal transition, whereas boys have a substantially longer growth period. After adjusting for dimorphism in size (height), adult males have greater total lean mass and mineral mass, and a lower fat mass than females. These whole-body differences are complemented by major differences in tissue distribution. Adult males have greater arm muscle mass, larger and stronger bones, and reduced limb fat, but a similar degree of central abdominal fat. Females have a more peripheral distribution of fat in early adulthood; however, greater parity and the menopause both induce a more android fat distribution with increasing age. Sex differences in body composition are primarily attributable to the action of sex steroid hormones, which drive the dimorphisms during pubertal development. Oestrogen is important not only in body fat distribution but also in the female pattern of bone development that predisposes to a greater female risk of osteoporosis in old age. Disorders of sex development are associated with significant abnormalities of body composition, attributable largely to their impact on mechanisms of hormonal regulation.},

This study aimed to describe population variability in body composition dimorphism, and to test whether annual temperature and proxies for population energy supply accounted for this variability. Data on sex-specific anthropometry (weight, stature, triceps, and subscapular skinfolds) and mean annual temperature were collated for 96 nonindustrialized populations. Lean mass and fat mass were calculated. Sexual dimorphism was expressed in sympercents. Sex-averaged skinfolds and stature were used as proxies for short-term and long-term energy supply, respectively. All outcomes showed significant mean dimorphism except body mass index. The magnitude of dimorphism was not randomly distributed across global regions, being lowest in African and Asian populations and greatest in Arctic populations. There was a negative correlation across populations between lean mass dimorphism and adiposity dimorphism, independent of temperature. With decreasing temperature, dimorphism in both lean mass and adiposity increased. Dimorphism increased in fatter but not taller populations, independently of temperature. The inverse correlation between lean mass dimorphism and adiposity dimorphism indicates a sex-trade-off between these two tissue accretion strategies. At colder temperatures, females invest disproportionately more in adiposity, and males disproportionately more in lean mass. Dimorphism also increased in proportion to proxies for short-term but not long-term energy availability. These findings suggest that phenotypic plasticity contributes to variability in body composition dimorphism, and that the occupation of dimorphic niches regarding reproductive energetics may be important.

The combined analyses of these have provided some general guidelines for the analysis of calculus that is non-destructive to archaeological teeth. There is still a need for a quantitative study of large numbers of calculus samples to establish protocols, assess the level of contamination, evaluate the quantity of microfossils in dental calculus, and to compare analysis results with the literature concerning the biology of calculus formation. We analyzed dental calculus from 53 teeth from four Brazilian sambaquis. Sambaquis are the shell-mounds that were established prehistorically along the Brazilian coast. The analysis of sambaqui dental calculi shows that there are relatively high concentrations of microfossils (phytoliths and starch), mineral fragments, and charcoal in dental calculus. Mineral fragments and charcoal are possibly contaminants. The largest dental calculi have the lowest concentrations of microfossils. Biologically, this is explained by individual variation in calculus formation between people. Importantly, starch is ubiquitous in dental calculus. The starch and phytoliths show that certainly Dioscorea (yam) and Araucaria angustifolia (Paran\'a pine) were eaten by sambaqui people. Araceae (arum family), Ipomoea batatas (sweet potato) and Zea mays (maize) were probably in their diet.},

  abstract = {Dental calculus (calcified tartar or plaque) is today widespread on modern human teeth around the world. A combination of soft starchy foods, changing acidity of the oral environment, genetic predisposition, and the absence of dental hygiene all lead to the build-up of microorganisms and food debris on the tooth crown, which eventually calcifies through a complex process of mineralisation. Millions of oral microbes are trapped and preserved within this mineralised matrix, including pathogens associated with the oral cavity and airways, masticated food debris, and other types of extraneous particles that enter the mouth. As a result, archaeologists and anthropologists are increasingly using ancient human dental calculus to explore broad aspects of past human diet and health. Most recently, high-throughput DNA sequencing of ancient dental calculus has provided valuable insights into the evolution of the oral microbiome and shed new light on the impacts of some of the major biocultural transitions on human health throughout history and prehistory. Here, we provide a brief historical overview of archaeological dental calculus research, and discuss the current approaches to ancient DNA sampling and sequencing. Novel applications of ancient DNA from dental calculus are discussed, highlighting the considerable scope of this new research field for evolutionary biology and modern medicine. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we describe the shotgun-sequencing of ancient DNA from five specimens of Neanderthal calcified dental plaque (calculus) and the characterization of regional differences in Neanderthal ecology. At Spy cave, Belgium, Neanderthal diet was heavily meat based and included woolly rhinoceros and wild sheep (mouflon), characteristic of a steppe environment. In contrast, no meat was detected in the diet of Neanderthals from El Sidron cave, Spain, and dietary components of mushrooms, pine nuts, and moss reflected forest gathering. Differences in diet were also linked to an overall shift in the oral bacterial community (microbiota) and suggested that meat consumption contributed to substantial variation within Neanderthal microbiota. Evidence for self-medication was detected in an El Sidron Neanderthal with a dental abscess and a chronic gastrointestinal pathogen (Enterocytozoon bieneusi). Metagenomic data from this individual also contained a nearly complete genome of the archaeal commensal Methanobrevibacter oralis (10.2x depth of coverage)-the oldest draft microbial genome generated to date, at around 48,000 years old. DNA preserved within dental calculus represents a notable source of information about the behaviour and health of ancient hominin specimens, as well as a unique system that is useful for the study of long-term microbial evolution.},

Therefore, describing the genetic composition of past populations in Central Asia holds value to understanding human mobility in this pivotal region. In this study, we analyse paleogenomic data generated from five humans from Kuygenzhar, Kazakhstan. These individuals date to the early to mid-18th century, shortly after the Kazakh Khanate was founded, a union of nomadic tribes of Mongol Golden Horde and Turkic origins. Genomic analysis identifies that these individuals are admixed with varying proportions of East Asian ancestry, indicating a recent admixture event from East Asia. The high amounts of DNA from the anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria Tannerella forsythia, a periodontal pathogen, recovered from their teeth suggest they may have suffered from periodontitis disease. Genomic analysis of this bacterium identified recently evolved virulence and glycosylation genes including the presence of antibiotic resistance genes predating the antibiotic era. This study provides an integrated analysis of individuals with a diet mostly based on meat (mainly horse and lamb), milk, and dairy products and their oral microbiome.},

Here, methods used to record its past prevalence are reviewed, including the problems associated with the use of measurements to record bone loss. Clinical and bioarchaeological research offers strong support for the Kerr method that records interdental septum morphological changes as a means of identifying gingivitis and periodontal disease. Using Kerr's approach, four assemblages from Sudan dating to the Neolithic, Kerma and Medieval periods are examined to track the progression of the disease through time. Results show a significantly lower prevalence of periodontal disease and a limited distribution across the mouth in the Neolithic period. Significant differences were found between the sexes at the Medieval sites, which were not present at the Neolithic and Kerma sites. With no patient history and the cumulative effects of a dynamic and episodic disease - only a snapshot of which is captured at death - the concept of `oral health' may be hard to apply in archaeological remains. As suggested by Kerr, it at best provides an insight into the periodontal status at death. Here, this `snapshot' reveals differences across the mouth, over time and between sexes.},

  abstract = {Abstract Variation in entheses has been attributed to repetitive mechanical stress, but age, sex, and genetics may also affect entheses. In this study, the insertion areas of the pronator teres, biceps brachii, deltoid, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, teres minor and subscapularis were measured. The skeletal sample included 137 American Blacks and Whites from the Terry and Hamann-Todd Human (20th century) collections and 238 skeletons from Hawikuh, New Mexico (1300\textendash 1680 AD); Indian Knoll, Kentucky (3300\textendash 2000 BC); Hardin Village, Kentucky (1500\textendash 1620 AD); Kushkokwim River, Alaska (protohistoric); and Mummy Cave, Alaska (protohistoric). There was no significant sexual dimorphism at Hawikuh, moderate levels for Indian Knoll and Hardin Village (12.8\textendash 15.2\%), and high levels for Kushkokwim River and Mummy Cave (22.6\textendash 32.8\%). All significant differences in these levels occurred between Alaskan and non-Alaskan populations. These findings suggest that cultural or genetic adaptations to climatic differences explain some of the variation in sexual dimorphism of the insertion areas. Lateral asymmetry in insertion areas show reduced levels of right-sided dominance when compared to maximum humeral length. Correlations between the frequency of longer right humeri and the frequency of handedness found in modern populations may be a by-product of developmental processes. The increased symmetry for muscle insertions indicates a closer correspondence to the true pattern of mechanical stress since many tasks involve both limbs. Males and females had smaller insertion areas in their 20s than in their 30s and 40s, but the difference was only significant for males. The greater differences between younger and older males when compared to females can be explained by the delayed physical maturation of males. There were no significant differences in humeral measurements with age. These results suggest that activity-related studies not rely solely on epiphyseal fusion of the long bones to estimate physical maturity. \textcopyright{} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}

In this study, the relationship between the oral fluid and the blood concentrations of drugs of abuse in drivers suspected of DUID is discussed. Blood and oral fluid samples were collected from drivers suspected of DUID or stopped during random controls by the police in Belgium, Germany, Finland, and Norway for the ROSITA-2 project. The blood samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), sometimes preceded by immunoassay screening of blood or urine samples. The oral fluid samples were analyzed by GC-MS or LC-MS(/MS). Scatter plots and trend lines of the blood and oral fluid concentrations and the median, mean, range, and SD of the oral fluid to blood (OF:B) ratios were calculated for amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cocaine, opiates, and {$\vartriangle$}9-2 tetrahydrocannabinol. The ratios found in this study were comparable with those that were published previously, but the range was wider. The OF:B ratios of basic drugs such as amphetamines, cocaine, and opiates were {$>$}1 [amphetamine: median (range) 13 (0.5-182), methylenedioxyamphetamine: 4 (1-15), methylenedioxymethamphetamine: 6 (0.9-88), methamphetamine: 5 (2-23), cocaine: 22 (4-119), benzoylecgonine: 1 (0.2-11), morphine: 2 (0.8-6), and codeine: 10 (0.8-39)]. The ratios for benzodiazepines were very low, as could be expected as they are highly protein bound and weakly acidic, leading to low oral fluid concentrations [diazepam: 0.02 (0.01-0.15), nordiazepam: 0.04 (0.01-0.23), oxazepam: 0.05 (0.03-0.14), and temazepam: 0.1 (0.06-0.54)]. For tetrahydrocannabinol, an OF:B ratio of 15 was found (range 0.01-569). In this study, the time of last administration, the dose, and the route of administration were unknown. Nevertheless, the data reflect the variability of the OF:B ratios in drivers thought to be under the influence of drugs. The wide range of the ratios, however, does not allow reliable calculation of the blood concentrations from oral fluid concentrations.},

New stature formulae have been calculated using forensic stature (FSTAT) and a combined dataset of forensic, cadaver, and measured statures referred to as Any Stature (ASTAT). The new FSTAT-based equations had an improved accuracy in Blacks with little improvement over Ousley's (4) equations for Whites. ASTAT-based equations performed equal to those of FSTAT equations and may be more appropriate, because they reflect both the variation in reported statures and in cadaver statures. It is essential to use not only equations based on forensic statures, but also equations based on modern samples.}

Here, we developed a framework for benchmarking differential abundance testing methods based on implanting signals into real data. This strategy yields a ground truth for benchmarking while retaining the statistical characteristics of real metagenomic data, which we quantitatively validated in comparison to previous approaches. Our benchmark revealed dramatic issues with elevated false discovery rates or limited sensitivity for the majority of methods with the exception of limma, linear models and the Wilcoxon test. When additionally modeling confounders, we observed these issues to be exacerbated, but also that linear mixed-effect models or the blocked Wilcoxon test effectively address them.

There are no guidelines for best practices for the treatment or reporting of missing data. As an initial step in taking stock and exploring approaches to missing data in bioarchaeology, this study reviews bioarchaeological publications to identify methods currently in use for addressing this significant problem. Materials and Methods Over 950 bioarchaeology articles (2011\textendash 2020) from four major anthropology journals were surveyed, searching for the terms ``missing,'' ``absent,'' ``unobserv,'' ``replace,'' and ``imputat.'' The 267 articles so identified were categorized into one of nine bioarchaeological subtopics and scored according to a set of six broad approaches for handling missing data. Results Results indicate that bioarchaeologists handle missing data in a variety of ways. Methods such as antimere substitution, listwise deletion and pairwise deletion are widely used. Subject subtopics favor different techniques for handling missing values. Bioarchaeological articles categorized as archaeology, pathology, and trauma used basic missing data approaches, while those such as biodistance and morphology more often employed advanced statistics. Despite the ubiquity of missing data, considerations of how they introduce bias were uncommon and standards for reporting were inconsistent. Conclusions These findings highlight areas in which bioarchaeologists can improve techniques for handling and reporting missing data. Greater attention to these shortcomings will increase the statistical rigor of the field.},

  abstract = {The objectives were to develop and characterize a procedure based on a ureolytic pH rise to deposit calcium phosphate into microcosm dental plaque biofilms and to test the importance of the plaque pH range. Plaque biofilms were cultured in a multiplaque culture system (`artificial mouth') with a continuous supply of a simulated oral fluid (basal medium mucin; BMM) with 146mmol/l (5\% w/v) sucrose periodically applied over 6min every 8h. After initial plaque growth, the biofilms were periodically exposed for up to 16 days to 6-min applications of calcium phosphate monofluorophosphate urea (CPMU) solution containing 20mmol/l CaCl2, 12mmol/l NaH2PO4, 5mmol/l monofluorophosphate and 500mmol/l urea (pH 5.0). Three application regimes were examined, one included a sucrose-induced acidic pH fluctuation. Plaque hydrolysis of the urea in CPMU caused the pH to rise to between 8.2 and 8.8, depositing fluoridated and carbonated calcium phosphates, and possibly some calcium carbonate, into the plaque. Calcium, phosphate and fluoride deposition was rapid for about 4 days and then slowed. After 10 days' treatment under standard conditions (BMM containing 1mmol/l urea and 1mmol/l arginine), plaque calcium and phosphate concentrations had increased up to 50-fold and 10-fold to approximately 2\textendash 4 and 1\textendash 2mmol/g plaque protein, respectively. The calcium, phosphate and fluoride content increased steadily. Calcium phosphate deposition was proportional to the plaque resting pH, increasing over four-fold when the BMM urea concentration was increased from 0 to 20mmol/l, which raised the resting pH from 6.4 to 7.2 and yielded a mean plaque calcium concentration of 14.3mmol/g protein, one subsample reaching 20.8mmol/g protein. Supplementation of BMM with 20\% human serum inhibited deposition. These results support the hypothesis that an alkaline pH in plaque is critical in promoting plaque mineralization and that mineral deposition is modulated by serum. These factors are likely to be important in regulating calculus formation.},

The aim here was to examine whether a new, chemically defined analogue of saliva (defined medium mucin, DMM) could substitute for a previously used, chemically undefined medium (basal medium mucin, BMM) as an analogue of saliva for large-scale biofilm culturing. DMM contains various ions, mucin, amino acids, vitamins and growth factors at concentrations generally similar to those in saliva, whereas BMM contains yeast extract, peptones and mucin. To model the nutrient functions of salivary proteins, amino acids equivalent to 5 g/l casein were also included in DMM. In earlier studies, BMM-grown plaques were similar to natural plaques in structure, composition, growth rate and pH response to substrates. Their doubling-time patterns over a 20-day period were similar, except that the DMM-grown plaques showed biphasic growth patterns that were more pronounced than with BMM. Variation in enzyme profiles between BMM- and DMM-grown plaque, measured using the API-ZYM technique, provided evidence of nutritional effects on plaque composition. It was concluded that realistic growth rates and patterns are generated in microcosm plaque biofilms by supplying both DMM and BMM. However, the use of DMM enables specific modifications to be made to nutrient conditions during large-scale culture in our 'artificial mouth' biofilm system.},

Immunoglobulin A (IgA), as the principal antibody class in the secretions that bathe these mucosal surfaces, acts as an important first line of defence. IgA, also an important serum immunoglobulin, mediates a variety of protective functions through interaction with specific receptors and immune mediators. The importance of such protection is underlined by the fact that certain pathogens have evolved mechanisms to compromise IgA-mediated defence, providing an opportunity for more effective invasion. IgA function may also be perturbed in certain disease states, some of which are characterized by deposition of IgA in specific tissues.

It contains a multitude of diverse biomolecules, providing information about an individual's culture, diet, ancestry, and health. Most researchers who study archaeological dental calculus use genomic or proteomic approaches, although a wide range of other techniques are now available. However, few studies have utilized efficient multiomic protocols. This lack of integration is problematic, as such approaches in other fields have proven to improve results and strengthen interpretations. Our review discusses three multiomic approaches: (1) interactions between the metaproteome and metagenome; (2) relationships between the host genome and oral metagenome; and, (3) associations between the epigenome and metagenome. We draw from multiomic studies on soil, plant, gut, and modern oral microbiomes to demonstrate how such integration can provide insights that are not attainable with single-omic approaches.},

Existing model-free estimators for optimal treatment regimes are usually not suitable for the purpose of inference, because they either have nonstandard asymptotic distributions or do not necessarily guarantee consistent estimation of the parameter indexing the Bayes rule due to the use of surrogate loss. We first study a smoothed robust estimator that directly targets the parameter corresponding to the Bayes decision rule for optimal treatment regimes estimation. This estimator is shown to have an asymptotic normal distribution. Furthermore, we verify that a resampling procedure provides asymptotically accurate inference for both the parameter indexing the optimal treatment regime and the optimal value function. A new algorithm is developed to calculate the proposed estimator with substantially improved speed and stability. Numerical results demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the new methods.},

  abstract = {Introduction:Cannabis sativa (hemp) seeds are popular for their high nutrient content, and strict regulations are in place to limit the amount of potentially harmful phytocannabinoids, especially {$\Delta$}(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol ({$\Delta$}(9)-THC). In Canada, this limit is 10\,{$\mu$}g of {$\Delta$}(9)-THC per gram of hemp seeds (10\,ppm), and other jurisdictions in the world follow similar guidelines. Materials and Methods: We investigated three different brands of consumer-grade hemp seeds using four different procedures to extract phytocannabinoids, and quantified total {$\Delta$}(9)-THC and cannabidiol (CBD). Discussion: We discovered that {$\Delta$}(9)-THC concentrations in these hemp seeds could be as high as 1250\% of the legal limit, and the amount of phytocannabinoids depended on the extraction procedure employed, Soxhlet extraction being the most efficient across all three brands of seeds. {$\Delta$}(9)-THC and CBD exhibited significant variations in their estimated concentrations even from the same brand, reflecting the inhomogeneous nature of seeds and variability due to the extraction method, but almost in all cases, {$\Delta$}(9)-THC concentrations were higher than the legal limit. These quantities of total {$\Delta$}(9)-THC may reach as high as 3.8\,mg per gram of hemp seeds, if one were consuming a 30-g daily recommended amount of hemp seeds, and is a cause for concern for potential toxicity. It is not clear if these high quantities of {$\Delta$}(9)-THC are due to contamination of the seeds, or any other reason. Conclusion: Careful consideration of the extraction method is very important for the measurement of cannabinoids in hemp seeds.},

It has significant applications in studying threshold effects and change-points. However, its application in practice has been limited by the lack of both rigorously studied and computationally convenient method for estimating knots. A key difficulty in estimating knots lies in the nondifferentiability. In this article, we study influence functions of regular and asymptotically linear estimators for linear spline models using the semiparametric theory. Based on the theoretical development, we propose a simple semismooth estimating equation approach to circumvent the nondifferentiability issue using modified derivatives, in contrast to the previous smoothing-based methods. Without relying on any smoothing parameters, the proposed method is computationally convenient. To further improve numerical stability, a two-step algorithm taking advantage of the analytic solution available when knots are known is developed to solve the proposed estimating equation. Consistency and asymptotic normality are rigorously derived using the empirical process theory. Simulation studies have shown that the two-step algorithm performs well in terms of both statistical and computational properties and improves over existing methods. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

However, the ability of the wombat's soft intestine to sculpt flat faces and sharp corners in feces is poorly understood. In this combined experimental and numerical study, we show one mechanism for the formation of corners in a highly damped environment. Wombat dissections show that cubes are formed within the last 17 percent of the intestine. Using histology and tensile testing, we discover that the cross-section of the intestine exhibits regions with a two-fold increase in thickness and a four-fold increase in stiffness, which we hypothesize facilitates the formation of corners by contractions of the intestine. Using a mathematical model, we simulate a series of azimuthal contractions of a damped elastic ring composed of alternating stiff and soft regions. Increased stiffness ratio and higher Reynolds number yield shapes that are more square. The corners arise from faster contraction in the stiff regions and relatively slower movement in the center of the soft regions. These results may have applications in manufacturing, clinical pathology, and digestive health.},

The purpose of this investigation was to gain further insights into the characteristics of proteins in whole saliva and in vivo formed pellicle components. To maximize separation and resolution using only micro-amounts of protein, a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis system was employed. Protein samples from parotid secretion, submandibular/sublingual secretion, whole saliva, and pellicle were subjected to isoelectric focusing followed by SDS-PAGE. Selected protein spots were excised, subjected to "in-gel" trypsin digestion, and examined by mass spectrometry (MS). The data generated, including peptide maps and tandem MS spectra, were analyzed using protein data base searches. Components identified in whole saliva include cystatins (SA-III, SA, and SN), statherin, albumin, amylase, and calgranulin A. Components identified in pellicle included histatins, lysozyme, statherin, cytokeratins, and calgranulin B. The results showed that whole saliva and pellicle have more complex protein patterns than those of glandular secretions. There are some similarities and also distinct differences between the patterns of proteins present in whole saliva and pellicle. MS approaches allowed identification of not only well characterized salivary proteins but also novel proteins not previously identified in pellicle.},

  abstract = {The oral microbiome plays key roles in human biology, health, and disease, but little is known about the global diversity, variation, or evolution of this microbial community. To better understand the evolution and changing ecology of the human oral microbiome, we analyzed 124 dental biofilm metagenomes from humans, including Neanderthals and Late Pleistocene to present-day modern humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas, as well as New World howler monkeys for comparison. We find that a core microbiome of primarily biofilm structural taxa has been maintained throughout African hominid evolution, and these microbial groups are also shared with howler monkeys, suggesting that they have been important oral members since before the catarrhine\textendash platyrrhine split ca. 40 Mya. However, community structure and individual microbial phylogenies do not closely reflect host relationships, and the dental biofilms of Homo and chimpanzees are distinguished by major taxonomic and functional differences. Reconstructing oral metagenomes from up to 100 thousand years ago, we show that the microbial profiles of both Neanderthals and modern humans are highly similar, sharing functional adaptations in nutrient metabolism. These include an apparent Homo-specific acquisition of salivary amylase-binding capability by oral streptococci, suggesting microbial coadaptation with host diet. We additionally find evidence of shared genetic diversity in the oral bacteria of Neanderthal and Upper Paleolithic modern humans that is not observed in later modern human populations. Differences in the oral microbiomes of African hominids provide insights into human evolution, the ancestral state of the human microbiome, and a temporal framework for understanding microbial health and disease.},

However, bioarchaeologists have not fully investigated the mortality risks associated with plaque (or its mineralized form, calculus) in the past. This study examines the relationship between survivorship and calculus in a medieval skeletal sample. Materials and methods Our sample (n = 1,098) from four medieval London cemeteries, c. 1000\textendash 1540 CE, includes people who died under attritional (normal) and catastrophic (famine and plague) conditions. The associations between age and the presence of dental calculus on the permanent left first mandibular molar are assessed using binary logistic regression and Kaplan\textendash Meier survival analysis. Results The regression results indicate a significant negative relationship between age and calculus presence for individuals of all ages who died under normal mortality conditions and for adults who died under both normal and catastrophic conditions. Survival analysis reveals decreased survivorship for people of all ages with calculus under normal mortality conditions. Similarly, during conditions of catastrophic mortality, adult males with calculus suffered reduced survivorship compared to males without it, though there was no difference in survivorship between adult females with and without calculus. Conclusions These results suggest that, as in modern populations, calculus accumulation in the inhabitants of medieval London reflects a greater risk of premature death. The evaluation of calculus, a potential measure of underlying frailty, in the context of a demographic measure of general health suggests that it might provide insights into health in past populations.},

Biological properties that confer stability in the microbiome are important for the prevention of dysbiosis-a microbial shift toward a disease, e.g., periodontitis or caries. Although processes that underlie oral diseases have been studied extensively, processes involved in maintaining of a normal, healthy microbiome are poorly understood. In this review we present our hypothesis on how a healthy oral microbiome is acquired and maintained. We introduce our view on the prenatal development of tolerance for the normal oral microbiome: we propose that development of fetal tolerance toward the microbiome of the mother during pregnancy is the major factor for a successful acquisition of a normal microbiome. We describe the processes that influence the establishment of such microbiome, followed by our perspective on the process of sustaining a healthy oral microbiome. We divide microbiome-maintenance factors into host-derived and microbe-derived, while focusing on the host. Finally, we highlight the need and directions for future research.},

Human whole saliva was collected from healthy donors. Three testing groups were calcium ion-enhanced saliva samples with an increased ion concentration of 1\,mmol/L, 5\,mmol/L, and 10\,mmol/L, respectively. Normal saliva was used as a control. The adsorption behavior was tested using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D), while the mechanical properties and lubricating behavior of salivary pellicle were examined by nano-indentation/scratch technique. Results show that the increased calcium ion concentration in the saliva weakens the electrostatic interaction between the salivary proteins and enamel surface, but causes increases in the thickness and viscoelasticity of the salivary pellicle formed on enamel surface. Therefore, the load-bearing and anti-shear capacity of the pellicle is improved, and then the anti-wear and friction-reducing effect of the pellicle is enhanced. In sum, the addition of calcium ion in saliva can contribute to the formation of the salivary pellicle with enhanced lubrication performance and help to alleviate the excessive tooth wear of xerostomia patients.},

The key experimental parameters that need to be considered in the development of an in situ model are the characteristics of the subject panel, the physical design of the model, the type of hard tissue substrate and the method of assessing mineral status, and the study design and clinical protocol. Each parameter must be carefully considered in relation to the objectives of the research, study design requirements, ethical considerations, impact on clinical relevance, and impact on the control of variation. The major source of variation associated with in situ models should be of biological and not experimental origin. The design and conduct of proper  in situ model studies require a clear understanding of the caries process, sound analytical support, and a knowledge of how to work with research subjects to achieve a high level of compliance. Given the complex nature of caries, a combination of hard tissue substrates-including sound, surface-softened lesions and subsurface lesions-may be necessary to model all aspects of caries progression and prevention successfully. Internal validation of in situ models using fluoride dose-response controls is considered to be necessary for studies evaluating the efficacy of new fluoride dentifrice formulations.},

There are key aspects of microbiome data, however, that limit the applicability of standard variable selection methods. In particular, the observed data are compositional, as the counts within each sample have a fixed-sum constraint. In addition, microbiome features, typically quantified as operational taxonomic units (OTUs), often reflect microorganisms that are similar in function, and may therefore have a similar influence on the response variable. To address the challenges posed by these aspects of the data structure, we propose a variable selection technique with the following novel features: a generalized transformation and z-prior to handle the compositional constraint, and an Ising prior that encourages the joint selection of microbiome features that are closely related in terms of their genetic sequence similarity. We demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing penalized approaches for microbiome variable selection in both simulation and the analysis of real data exploring the relationship of the gut microbiome to body mass index (BMI).},

The objective of this study was to determine whether CNPs are present in the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) from subjects with periodontal disease and whether they can induce the pathologic calcification of primary cultured human gingival epithelial cells. Methods: GCF and dental calculus samples were collected from 10 subjects with gingivitis and 10 subjects with chronic periodontitis. CNPs in GCF and calculus filtrates were detected with nanocapture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The CNPs in cultures of dental calculus filtrates were also identified using immunofluorescence staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and chemical analysis. Pathologic changes in the CNP-treated gingival epithelial cells were observed with TEM, alizarin red staining, and disk-scanning confocal microscopy. Results: CNPs were found in GCF samples from two subjects with chronic periodontitis. Based on chemical analysis, the surface-associated material from CNPs isolated and cultured from calculus has a composition similar to dental calculus. The pathologic calcification of CNP-treated gingival epithelial cells was also observed. Conclusions: Self-replicating calcifying nanoparticles can be cultured and identified from dental calculus. This raises the issue of whether CNPs contribute to the pathogenesis of periodontitis. J Periodontol 2009;80:1462-1470.},

Black teas gave higher levels of inhibition than green teas, and removal of tea tannins with gelatin led to the loss of inhibitory activity from all decoctions. Streptococcal amylase was similarly inhibited by tea decoctions. Fluoride was without effect on amylase. Since salivary amylase hydrolyzes food starch to low molecular weight fermentable carbohydrates, experiments were carried out to determine whether tea decoctions would interfere with the release of maltose in food particles that became entrapped on the dentition. Subjects consumed salted crackers and rinsed subsequently for 30 s with black or green tea decoctions, or water. Maltose release was reduced by up to about 70\% after rinsing with the teas. Black tea decoction was significantly more effective than green tea, in agreement with the in vitro data. The observations supported the hypothesis that tea consumption can be effective in reducing the cariogenic potential of starch-containing foods such as crackers and cakes. Tea may reduce the tendency for these foods to serve as slow-release sources of fermentable carbohydrate.}

Complete mixing conditions in the two reactors were verified by measuring water content, and polysaccharide and protein quantities from three vertical sampling positions over time. Experimental results showed that: (1) the biofilm water content of either reactor did not change with sample position or biofilm age, with an average biofilm water content m both reactors of 97\%; (2) polysaccharides and proteins in the ECPs did not change with sample position; (3) the profiles of polysaccharides and proteins along the biofilm depth showed a stratified biofilm structure, with their ratio (proteins/polysaccharides) being relatively stable over the depth. Oxygen and substrate transport and interactions among species were considered to be the main reasons for producing such a non-uniform biofilm structure; and (4) Sphingomonas sp. could not compete well with microorganisms derived from the mixed liquor of a wastewater treatment plant aeration basin.},

Plant macroremains like seeds/fruits, wood, and stems were discovered in the Yanghai cemetery. Altogether 25 species of plant were found, including three cereals, one type of fruit tree, two medicinal plants, one plant for decoration, and five types of wood for fire drilling, as well as some other plants. The date range of the samples discussed in this paper is around 900\textendash 200 BC. It is suggested that the Yanghai people once lived in a relatively humid area like an oasis with local water resources. They lived mainly pastorally and cultivated common millet, naked barley, and wheat as a supplement. However, the evidence of viticulture indicates that they led a sedentary life rather than being mobile pastoralists. It is notable that Cannabis was used not only for medicine but also for shamanistic use.

  abstract = {Plant secondary metabolites are unique sources for pharmaceuticals, food additives, flavors, and other industrial materials. Accumulation of such metabolites often occurs in plants subjected to stresses including various elicitors or signal molecules. Understanding signal transduction paths underlying elicitor-induced production of secondary metabolites is important for optimizing their commercial production. This paper summarizes progress made on several aspects of elicitor signal transduction leading to production of plant secondary metabolites, including: elicitor signal perception by various receptors of plants; avirulence determinants and corresponding plant R proteins; heterotrimeric and small GTP binding proteins; ion fluxes, especially Ca2+ influx, and Ca2+ signaling; medium alkalinization and cytoplasmic acidification; oxidative burst and reactive oxygen species; inositol trisphosphates and cyclic nucleotides (cAMP and cGMP); salicylic acid and nitric oxide; jasmonate, ethylene, and abscisic acid signaling; oxylipin signals such as allene oxide synthase-dependent jasmonate and hydroperoxide lyase-dependent C12 and C6 volatiles; as well as other lipid messengers such as lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidic acid, and diacylglycerol. All these signal components are employed directly or indirectly by elicitors for induction of plant secondary metabolite accumulation. Cross-talk between different signaling pathways is very common in plant defense response, thus the cross-talk amongst these signaling pathways, such as elicitor and jasmonate, jasmonate and ethylene, and each of these with reactive oxygen species, is discussed separately. This review also highlights the integration of multiple signaling pathways into or by transcription factors, as well as the linkage of the above signal components in elicitor signaling network through protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Some perspectives on elicitor signal transduction and plant secondary metabolism at the transcriptome and metabolome levels are also presented.},

  abstract = {The genus Veillonella comprises 16 characterized species, among which eight are commonly found in the human oral cavity. The high abundance of Veillonella species in the microbiome of both supra- and sub-gingival biofilms, and their interdependent relationship with a multitude of other bacterial species, suggest veillonellae to play an important role in oral biofilm ecology. Development of oral biofilms relies on an incremental coaggregation process between early, bridging and later bacterial colonizers, ultimately forming multispecies communities. As early colonizer and bridging species, veillonellae are critical in guiding the development of multispecies communities in the human oral microenvironment. Their ability to establish mutualistic relationships with other members of the oral microbiome has emerged as a crucial factor that may contribute to health equilibrium. Here, we review the general characteristics, taxonomy, physiology, genomic and genetics of veillonellae, as well as their bridging role in the development of oral biofilms. We further discuss the role of Veillonella spp. as potential ``accessory pathogens'' in the human oral cavity, capable of supporting colonization by other, more pathogenic species. The relationship between Veillonella spp. and dental caries, periodontitis, and peri-implantitis is also recapitulated in this review. We finally highlight areas of future research required to better understand the intergeneric signaling employed by veillonellae during their bridging activities and interspecies mutualism. With the recent discoveries of large species and strain-specific variation within the genus in biological and virulence characteristics, the study of Veillonella as an example of highly adaptive microorganisms that indirectly participates in dysbiosis holds great promise for broadening our understanding of polymicrobial disease pathogenesis.},

Specifically, the V3 region (E. coli 341-534) of this gene has been suggested as an excellent candidate for ancient DNA amplification and microbial community reconstruction. However, in practice this metataxonomic approach often produces highly skewed taxonomic frequency data. In this study, we use non-targeted (shotgun metagenomics) sequencing methods to better understand skewed microbial profiles observed in four ancient dental calculus specimens previously analyzed by amplicon sequencing. Through comparisons of microbial taxonomic counts from paired amplicon (V3 U341F/534R) and shotgun sequencing datasets, we demonstrate that extensive length polymorphisms in the V3 region are a consistent and major cause of differential amplification leading to taxonomic bias in ancient microbiome reconstructions based on amplicon sequencing. We conclude that systematic amplification bias confounds attempts to accurately reconstruct microbiome taxonomic profiles from 16S rRNA V3 amplicon data generated using universal primers. Because in silico analysis indicates that alternative 16S rRNA hypervariable regions will present similar challenges, we advocate for the use of a shotgun metagenomics approach in ancient microbiome reconstructions.},

Although most DNA within calculus is microbial, it has been shown to contain sufficient human DNA for the targeted retrieval of whole mitochondrial genomes. Here, we explore whether calculus is also a viable substrate for whole human genome recovery using targeted enrichment techniques. Total DNA extracted from 24 paired archaeological human dentin and calculus samples was subjected to whole human genome enrichment using in-solution hybridization capture and high-throughput sequencing. Total DNA from calculus exceeded that of dentin in all cases, and although the proportion of human DNA was generally lower in calculus, the absolute human DNA content of calculus and dentin was not significantly different. Whole genome enrichment resulted in up to four-fold enrichment of the human endogenous DNA content for both dentin and dental calculus libraries, albeit with some loss in complexity. Recovering more on-target reads for the same sequencing effort generally improved the quality of downstream analyses, such as sex and ancestry estimation. For nonhuman DNA, comparison of phylum-level microbial community structure revealed few differences between precapture and postcapture libraries, indicating that off-target sequences in human genome-enriched calculus libraries may still be useful for oral microbiome reconstruction. While ancient human dental calculus does contain endogenous human DNA sequences, their relative proportion is low when compared with other skeletal tissues. Whole genome enrichment can help increase the proportion of recovered human reads, but in this instance enrichment efficiency was relatively low when compared with other forms of capture. We conclude that further optimization is necessary before the method can be routinely applied to archaeological samples.}

Moreover, oral biofilms are widely studied as model systems for bacterial adhesion, biofilm development, and biofilm resistance to antibiotics, due to their widespread presence and accessibility. Despite descriptions of initial plaque formation on the tooth surface, studies on mature plaque and plaque structure below the gum are limited to landmark studies from the 1970s, without appreciating the breadth of microbial diversity in the plaque. We used fluorescent in situ hybridization to localize in vivo the most abundant species from different phyla and species associated with periodontitis on seven embedded teeth obtained from four different subjects. The data showed convincingly the dominance of Actinomyces sp., Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Spirochaetes, and Synergistetes in subgingival plaque. The latter proved to be new with a possibly important role in host-pathogen interaction due to its localization in close proximity to immune cells. The present study identified for the first time in vivo that Lactobacillus sp. are the central cells of bacterial aggregates in subgingival plaque, and that Streptococcus sp. and the yeast Candida albicans form corncob structures in supragingival plaque. Finally, periodontal pathogens colonize already formed biofilms and form microcolonies therein. These in vivo observations on oral biofilms provide a clear vision on biofilm architecture and the spatial distribution of predominant species.},

  abstract = {A particular type of miniature ceramic vessel locally known as ``veneneras'' is occasionally found during archaeological excavations in the Maya Area. To date, only one study of a collection of such containers successfully identified organic residues through coupled chromatography\textendash mass spectrometry methods. That study identified traces of nicotine likely associated with tobacco. Here we present a more complete picture by analyzing a suite of possible complementary ingredients in tobacco mixtures across a collection of 14 miniature vessels. The collection includes four different vessel forms and allows for the comparison of specimens which had previously formed part of museum exhibitions with recently excavated, untreated containers. Archaeological samples were compared with fresh as well as cured reference materials from two different species of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum and N. rustica). In addition, we sampled six more plants which are linked to mind-altering practices through Mesoamerican ethnohistoric or ethnographic records. Analyses were conducted using UPLC-MS metabolomics-based analytical techniques, which significantly expand the possible detection of chemical compounds compared to previous biomarker-focused studies. Results include the detection of more than 9000 residual chemical features. We trace, for the first time, the presence of Mexican marigold (Tagetes lucida) in presumptive polydrug mixtures.},

  abstract = {The origin and evolution of the infectious disease tuberculosis (TB) and its pathogens is still not fully understood. An important effort for a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of TB evolution lies within the investigation of skeletal and mummified material dating back several thousand of years. In this work, molecular data from mummified and skeletal material from different time periods of the Old World are compared, and the current status of ancient mycobacterial DNA analysis in ancient human remains is discussed, with particular reference to the genetic evolution of human TB. The molecular analysis of material from southern Germany (1400\textendash 1800 AD), Hungary (600\textendash 1700 AD) and Egypt (3500\textendash 500 BC) revealed high frequencies of TB in all time periods. In several individuals from ancient Egypt the mycobacterial DNA could be further characterised by spoligotyping. Thereby, evidence for ancestral M. tuberculosis strains was found in the pre- to early dynastic material from Abydos (3500\textendash 2650 BC), while typical M. africanum signatures were detected in the Middle Kingdom tomb in Thebes-West (2050\textendash 1650 BC). Samples from the New Kingdom to Late Period tombs (1500\textendash 500 BC) were characterised as modern M. tuberculosis strains. In concordance with other studies on ancient skeletal and mummified samples, no evidence for the presence of M. bovis was found. These results contradict the theory that M. tuberculosis evolved from M. bovis during domestication, but supports the new scenario that M. tuberculosis probably derived from an ancestral progenitor strain.

  abstract = {Over the past several decades, the field of paleopathology has rapidly advanced, but a continuing delay in incorporating scientific advances and a lack of methodological rigor hinder its progress. Inconsistencies in the presentation of data, the persistent use of non-standardized criteria and non-specific skeletal lesions to diagnose diseases, and the misuse of or delay in adopting critical, relevant concepts and methods from other disciplines obfuscate the current state of evidence and unnecessarily prolong debates. Here, we present three major research questions that have been affected by these issues: the origin and antiquity of syphilis in the Old World; the pathogen responsible for the Black Death; and whether the incidence of cancer has risen in recent human history. Drawing on these examples, we conclude with recommendations that could facilitate a more rigorous, scientific approach to important questions in paleopathology.
