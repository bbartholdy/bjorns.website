  abstract = {Dental calculus is increasingly used by researchers to study dietary patterns in past populations. The benefits of using dental calculus for this purpose have been clearly demonstrated in previous studies, with dental calculus harbouring a wealth of microremains and biomarkers for health and diet within its mineral matrix. Previous studies have demonstrated some of the limitations and biases of how methods of processing may overlook, or even remove, some of the important information contained within the mineralised matrix. However, there are many factors that are impossible to account for *in vivo* and in archaeological material, such as exact dietary intake, and individual factors such as pH and enzyme activity, leaving some limitations that may not be addressed through these types of studies and will require a different approach. We present a protocol for creating a calcifying oral biofilm model that can be used to explore the biases and limitations of dental calculus as a medium for paleodietary reconstructions. We report the microbial and mineral composition of our model in an effort to validate the model calculus as an appropriate proxy to natural dental calculus. The microbial profile and species diversity of our model was determined using metagenomic classification with the nf-core/eager pipeline and Kraken2, and compared to various reference samples from oral sites, including saliva, plaque, and dental calculus. We then assessed whether our model calculus mineralises in a manner similar to natural dental calculus using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The metagenomic classification showed a microbial profile predominantly made up of (facultative) anaerobes, with a community structure that was somewhat distinct from other oral reference samples. The core genera of the model consisted of oral species, but clustered separately from oral reference samples, with a higher abundance of anaerobes. Mineral and organic components of our model mimic that of the modern and archaeological reference calculus that was used as a comparison. There was an overall increase in the inorganic component relative to organic over the course of the experiment, with carbonated hydroxyapatite as the principal compound, consistent with natural human-derived calculus. We conclude that oral biofilm models, such as the one presented in this study, have great potential to validate current methods used in the analysis of archaeological dental calculus, and should be used to complement, rather than replace current *in vivo* studies.},

  abstract = {Sex estimation is an important part of creating a biological profile for skeletal remains in forensics. The commonly used methods for developing sex estimation equations are discriminant function analysis (DFA) and logistic regression (LogR). LogR equations provide a probability of the predicted sex, while DFA relies on cutoff points to segregate males and females, resulting in a rigid dichotomization of the sexes. This is problematic because sexual dimorphism exists along a continuum and there can be considerable overlap in trait expression between the sexes. In this study, we used humeral measurements to compare the performance of DFA and LogR and found them to be very similar under multiple conditions. The overall cross-validated (leave-one-out) accuracy of DFA (75.76\textendash 95.14\%) was slightly higher than LogR (75.76\textendash 93.82\%) for simple and multiple variable equations, and also performed better under varying sample sizes (94.03\% vs. 93.78\%). Three of five DFA equations outperformed LogR under the B index, while all five LogR equations outperformed the DFA equations under the Q index. Both methods saw an improvement in overall accuracy (DFA: 86.74\textendash 95.79\%; LogR: 86.74\textendash 95.76\%) when individuals with a classification probability lower than 0.80 were excluded. Additionally, we propose a method for calculating additional cutoff points (PMarks) based on posterior probability values. In conclusion, we recommend using LogR over DFA due to the increased flexibility, robusticity, and benefits for future users of the statistical models; however, if DFA is preferred, use of the proposed PMarks facilitates future analysis while avoiding unnecessary dichotomization.},

  abstract = {Abstract The main aim of this study is to present a novel method of nonadult (ca. 1\textendash 19~years) age-at-death estimation using the dental wear of deciduous, mixed deciduous-permanent, and permanent dentitions, including the incisors, canines, premolars, and first and second molars. The stage-based method is derived from degrees of dental wear in known-age (n~=~39) and estimated-age (n~=~11) nonadults containing 951 teeth from the predominately 19th century cemetery of Middenbeemster, The Netherlands. The need for such a method is warranted in cases where dental development and/or eruption cannot be assessed for age-at-death estimation. As well, by establishing a baseline for normal age-related nonadult tooth wear, users may better document wear that could be due to extramasticatory behaviours. The regression analysis reveals a strong quadratic correlation\textemdash F(2, 47)~=~555.1, p~{$<~$}.001, R2~=~.95, standard error of the estimate~=~1.14, residual sum of squares (RSS)~=~68.89, predicted residual error sum of squares (PRESS)~=~77.67\textemdash between age and wear and multivariate adaptive regression splines (R2~=~.95, generalised cross validation~=~1.67, RSS~=~67.68, PRESS~=~89.34), which are used to develop an R-package that users may employ to estimate age-at-death from dental wear. The accuracy of this method (78\textendash 98\%) is evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Analyses of males versus females, deciduous versus permanent, upper versus lower, and anterior versus posterior teeth revealed no apparent reason to warrant separate methods for these groups of separated dentitions. This method fills a disciplinary gap in the understudied area of deciduous and nonadult dental wear and hopes to stimulate much future research. With the R-package, we also provide the foundation and framework for the development of additional reference populations across different spatiotemporal contexts, to make the method more widely applicable.}

  abstract = {Dental calculus has proven to contain a wealth of information on the dietary habits of past populations. These insights have, to a large extent, been obtained by the extraction and identification of starch granules contained within the mineralised dental plaque from a wide range of regions and time periods. The scope of previous studies have been limited to microfossil extraction and identification to reconstruct dietary preferences from the archaeological record, and few studies have attempted to address the biases of starch retention in dental calculus. Those that have considered this problem have been limited to in vivo studies on modern humans and non-human primates. Here, we present a multispecies oral biofilm model, which allows experimental research on starch incorporation and retention to be conducted on in vitro dental calculus in a controlled laboratory setting. The biofilms were exposed to treatment solutions with known quantities of dietary starches (wheat and potato) during the 25~days growth period. After this, the starch granules were extracted from the mature biofilm (by dissolution in EDTA), and counted. We show that the granule counts extracted from the model dental calculus represented a low proportion (ranging from 0.06\% to 0.16\%) of the total number of granules exposed to the biofilms throughout the experiment. Additionally, we found that the ratios of granule sizes from the extracted starch granules differed from the original treatment solutions, with large granules ({$>$}20~{$\mu$}m) consistently being under-represented. We also found a positive correlation between the absolute granule counts and dry-weight of the biofilm (r = 0.659, 90\%CI[0.463, 0.794]), meaning the absolute quantity of starch granules will increase as the size of the calculus deposit increases. A similar, but weaker correlation was found between the concentration (count per mg) of granules and dry-weight (r = 0.3, 90\%CI[0.0618, 0.506]). Our results complement and reinforce previous in vivo studies suggesting that dental calculus presents a very small, and partly biased picture of the original dietary intake of starches, with an over-representation of plants producing granules smaller than 20~{$\mu$}m in size. The experimental model presented here is well-suited to address the need for further validation of methods and biases associated with dietary research on dental calculus.},
